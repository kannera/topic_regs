costep_1999-09-16_10_3	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must be aware of the fact that there is seething unrest in the Caucasus. Right now it concerns the tragic fate of the people in Dagestan. Most news reports only give us a scant account of the drama taking place in this part of the world. We need humanitarian aid there urgently. The main thing would be above all for these people in Dagestan to be granted the same autonomy as they already have in neighbouring states. So what is happening? There is clearly a lack of objective information on the political situation there, but there is also a lack of respect for human rights. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe must be commissioned to prepare a report for our Parliament, the Commission and the Council, and the task which faces us generally in our various Groups must be directed particularly at obtaining such information as quickly as possible and reliably. Regardless of where responsibility lies for the situation in Dagestan, the fact remains that it is a result of the dramatic developments following the fall of the iron curtain and that the countries in this region have only managed with great difficulty to liberate themselves. In addition, the political authorities responsible continue to attempt to regulate ethnic groups and to create divisions between them. We have seen this in direct proximity to us in Europe in the former Yugoslavia, and now we are observing similar developments further away. We must do all we can to extinguish the fire that has been kindled there, so that the people in this part of the world also have the possibility of developing in peace, establishing their own autonomy, and having a future, such as we have already secured for ourselves in Europe. We should not forget that a few decades ago we lived through a similar fate here in Europe. We were then reasonable and came to an understanding, and it is now our job to help people there in their development, which may perhaps run a similar course, but which can in any case offer them the possibility of a future, in which their existence is secure, and where they can take control of their own destiny.
costep_2000-12-13_7_13	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal of the European Commission intended to make the purchasing of digital products which can be downloaded directly from the Internet by consumers resident in the Union from extra-Community firms subject to VAT is a heavy blow for the development of e-commerce. The goal which the Commission would like to achieve is to eliminate the disadvantage suffered by European e-businesses whose sales to European consumers are already subject to VAT. Nevertheless, the solution proposed will prove to be technically unmanageable and a barrier to the development of on-line transactions within the Union, at the very time when everybody is hoping for its expansion. The point has been made from several quarters, even within the Council, which has decided to give itself more time, that the proposal is weak, that it leaves gaps and that it is such as to induce numerous objections. I will quote but a few: it appears that it would be impossible to apply the measures adopted without active cooperation from the other countries, particularly the United States, which is currently not at all disposed to cooperate. What would happen if an Eastern European country failed to register in Europe for VAT purposes? Would the site be blocked or would we prosecute the users who continued to download files from offshore sites? When all is said and done, any benefit would go to the companies who, with relative ease and certain impunity, refused to comply with the registration obligation. How can an e-business be certain that its clients have declared their true place of residence? If the European criteria of the registration obligation were to be taken up internationally for e-commerce taxation, the businesses complying with the obligation, including European businesses, would be forced to register in dozens and dozens of countries, incurring increasingly unreasonable expenses, especially where smaller firms are concerned. I could say more, for example on the decision to tax the sale of all electronic equipment etc. Moreover, this enthusiasm for negligible amounts of taxable income and tax revenue is incomprehensible. The Commission should rather endeavour to ensure that a common, definitive definition of the e-business taxation criteria reaches the OSCE or the WTO. For these reasons we will vote against the report.
costep_2011-05-11_6_318	Having noted, and I quote and now utter the following euphemism - 'a lack of values and ethics in the behaviour of certain actors in the financial markets and institutions' - this Parliament has set off on a pathetic crusade to inject some ethics into the sector. To use the word crusade is perhaps to overstate the case. It might be better to say that some pious hopes are expressed that finally, the interests of customers and workers should be taken into account. There is some pitiful bleating about social, cultural and 'gender' diversity on boards of directors (quotas for the Roma, no doubt?). There are some proposals, which have already largely been adopted at European level, on the indecent remunerations in the sector, where we could do considerably better. There are some risk controls here and there. In short, the point that escapes you is the fact that companies are merely playing by the rules that you set. Now these rules, rules that you are basically refusing to question, are the free international movement of capital, the financialisation of the economy, an over-emphasis on the short term, securitisation, complex financial products that are not based on any concrete wealth creation and the constitution of large multinational groups which are more powerful than States and are not subject to control. Until you deal with the foundations of this system, you will change nothing.
costep_2001-05-31_2_8	Mr President, the report by Mr Ribeiro e Castro gives a clear and thorough exposition of the Commission document and its shortcomings. Firstly, the rapporteur requires more information on the results of the EURES network. I fully support that, since it definitely remains obscure how the results of EURES relate to the state of affairs in European labour markets. Secondly, the Commission document shows clearly that Member States could make fuller use of the potential of the EURES network, in view of the differences between Member States in the number of vacancies in the network: international recruitment will not be realistic for all vacancies. In the same way the call to encourage all border regions to enter into a EURES partnership has not been supported with arguments based on the need for community support expressed by the regions themselves. The obstacles are not found in the first place between adjacent regions, but concern mobility over greater distances, that is, they are 'transnational' rather than 'cross-border' in nature. EU enlargement implies that a shift in emphasis from cross-border to transnational mobility will become more likely. My third point concerns the necessary subsidiarity. Both the Commission and the rapporteur raise the point that local familiarity with the network leaves much to be desired. However, local information is the responsibility of the local players. For that reason, reserving a substantial portion of the budget for promotion is undesirable. On the other hand, I can fully support the call for decentralisation. The term of the budget is also a discussion point. The Commission wants a budget extending over several years as this facilitates planning. I have no problems with long-term budgets as such, but I do with the scope and nature of the community package of responsibilities proposed by the Commission. That leads me to prefer an annual establishment of the budget. In conclusion the attention paid by the rapporteur to expansion has my support. After the political decision on the free movement of employees is taken for the candidate countries, the mobility of labour must no longer be restricted by inadequate cooperation in employment provision.
costep_2003-01-29_3_19	Mr President, Mr Solana, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I will begin with a quotation, one which sums up like no other statement our position on the war against Iraq: 'A preventive war is an act of aggression, and cannot be described as a just war in self-defence. For the right to self-defence presupposes not merely the possibility of an attack, but that an attack is actually happening or is imminent. Warfare with the aim of averting danger would nullify international law’s prohibition of force, promote political instability and, in the final analysis, shatter the foundations of the whole system of an international community of states.' And elsewhere in the same statement: 'Any security strategy committing itself to preventive warfare is in defiance both of Catholic teaching and of international law.' These quotations are from the statement on the Iraq conflict issued, on 20 January of this year, by the Conference of German Bishops. As my Christian Democrat opposite number has not made reference to the Conference of Catholic Bishops, I have to do so, and do not think that these statements require anything to be added to them. All the time I have known you, Mr Solana, I have regarded you as a great optimist, so when you say, as you have done today, that the political situation is bad, then the political situation is very bad. Donald Rumsfeld, the American minister for war, spoke of 'old Europe'. All of us who have spoken here today have declared that we belong to this old Europe, and that would not be cause for any further excitement on our part, had he not drawn the distinction between us and the 'new Europe' - those whose opinions are identical with Mr Rumsfeld’s and who think along the same lines as he does. President Kwasniewski of Poland said in an interview last week, 'If it is President Bush’s vision, it is mine!' The Polish President is of course entitled to as narrow a field of vision as he may choose, but there is no doubt that the Polish government - like all the governments of the other candidate countries - is under an obligation to act in solidarity with the European Union, to which they want to belong. The candidate countries have decided of their own free will to belong to the European Union, and we wish to welcome them, but, when it comes to issues of war and peace, preventive warfare and the setting-aside of international law, we expect them to be solidly alongside us.
costep_2001-04-04_5_7	Mr President, to analyse this year zero of the Tampere era we have, for the first time, a tool that will be extraordinarily useful, both now and in the future: the scoreboard set up by the Commission which, in future years, should include the progress made in the Council and the progress made in each of the Member States. A comparison between the initial forecasts and the latest revision of the scoreboard shows, for instance, how we have progressed - I would say remarkably - in matters of judicial cooperation. We have hopes for the future of Eurojust and this Parliament welcomes the decisions taken by the Council and the Member States' initiatives which, in the field of judicial cooperation, have added to the Commission proposals, thus creating a circle that should be maintained in future. My Group also values the highly significant Commission communication on the mutual recognition of sentences in criminal matters. We hope it will be a solid base from which to combat crime, especially those more callous and intolerable versions such as terrorism. Ministers, we are well aware of what the European Commission has presented this last year in connection with the Tampere Agenda: it is on the scoreboard. What we do not know is what the Council is thinking of doing with them in the immediate future. In exchange, we have seen concrete and fragmentary proposals - I do not want to return to the debate we had in the previous sitting - from each Member State, which in this case we cannot accept at all, either now or in the future. Today we have also talked about the shock caused by the arrival of the East Sea in Europe. It shocked everyone, and I think it would have done so even more if the citizens knew that even before Tampere we had set up something which (talking of cooperation with the countries of origin) is called an action plan for northern Iraq, i.e. the Kurds. But the citizens do not know. Just as those of my country do not know that we have set up an action plan for Morocco, and while they keep finding the bodies of our young neighbours on their beaches they wonder what the European Union is doing. In fact, the impression given by the press is that not even our government knows. Laeken is going to be a new opportunity for the common immigration and asylum policy. Please do not just reaffirm the Tampere decisions again. Tell us how you intend to move forward. Please do not repeat that things are on the right road. Really convince yourselves that your decisions are good ones, and uphold them clearly and with determination and courage. Parliament - and I am sure in this respect the citizens too - will follow.
costep_2000-12-14_8_13	Mr President, allow me to start by welcoming Imen Derwiche and Nourredine Ben Tisha to the public gallery; they are young Tunisian students who were tortured and imprisoned for several months. Action is needed quickly, which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda. The very existence of the oldest human rights league in Africa and the Arab-speaking world, the Tunisian League, is under threat, despite being recognised by President Ben Ali. Judicial proceedings to have it wound up were instituted following its last congress, which appointed directors who are obviously not to the Tunisian authorities' liking. Its fate is to be decided at a hearing scheduled for 25 December, which is surprising, because this date is also a Muslim public holiday this year. As we speak, police forces have surrounded the premises of the Tunisian National Council for Liberties and even the private residences of some of its members. This police operation has already used force to prevent the National Council of the League from meeting in Bizerte and the Tunisian National Council for Liberties from meeting in Tunis. Its spokesman, Moncef Marzouki, risks being sentenced to over 10 years in prison at a hearing the day after tomorrow, on 16 December. Finally, political prisoners have been on hunger strike in prison, some of them for two months. Some, such as Béchir Habid, are in a critical condition. Their very life is in danger. Repression is on the rise, arrests and intolerable cases of torture are increasing in number. This is no longer a question of attacks on the freedom of expression, association or assembly; now, freedom of movement, freedom of speech and the freedom to receive persons of one’s choice are difficult to exercise in Tunisia. Men and women are harassed daily and their families harassed as well. One example is Mehdi Zougah, a French-Tunisian citizen, who was arrested at Tunis airport on 11 August. For four months his wife and children have been waiting for him at home in Marseilles. He will stand trial on 8 January on charges of having attended a meeting of the Tunisian opposition in France, which he denies. It is a case of the most blatant arbitrariness. The Tunisian authorities should pay heed to the concern and outrage being expressed in this Chamber. They should listen to the representative of the UN Secretary-General for human rights who expressed her acute concern on 7 December, calling for an end to the practice of harassing defenders of human rights. The Tunisian authorities should realise once and for all that we are determined not to relax our vigilance and to continue to press for fundamental rights to be respected.
costep_1999-10-27_5_6	Mr President, Commissioner, I am delighted that we have been able to hold this debate in the European Parliament on the tidal wave of company restructuring that we are witnessing and the massive job losses that accompany it. My Group had expressed its desire to do so at the time of the Michelin affair. In other words, and this has just been reiterated, the simultaneous announcement made by the management of this huge company to financial analysts of achieving substantial profits on the one hand, and the decision to shed 7,500 jobs in Europe on the other. Although this initiative was immediately welcomed by the stock exchange, where its share value immediately rose, it also caused great indignation in large sectors of public opinion, particularly in France but also in other countries, as I have seen myself. To some extent, the cynicism of the Michelin method has had the effect of increasing tenfold the phenomenon of rejection which this modern capitalist strategy is itself bringing about, the strategy known as share-holder value, the creation of value for the shareholder which consists of subordinating everything, especially employment costs which in their eyes are intolerable, to the bulimic demands of the shareholders who finance business. Michelin is unfortunately far from being the exception in this area. Its provocative announcement fits into the context of a veritable gangrene which we cannot allow to develop without reacting to it, unless we ourselves renounce any control over economic and social development and, as a result, the ambition to promote a European Social Model in the midst of globalisation. The same applies to Olivetti which, having found the capital necessary for its lucrative take-over bid for Telecom Italia, arranged to shed 13,000 jobs. The same applies to Alcatel which, in order to regain the confidence of its financial shareholders, at the same time announced a net profit of FRF 15 billion, that is EUR 2.3 billion, and 12,000 job losses. The same thing applies to the banking sector where the arrival of the euro gave a veritable boost to the mergers and acquisitions which eat up jobs and which shifted the emphasis of banking towards financial and even speculative activities. The sad record is held by Renault which is gratifying its shareholders with its swingeing job cuts at Nissan even if it means exporting the most horrendous image of Europe to Japan whilst, as an indirect result, shedding several thousand jobs within the European Union itself. But what can we do? Governments have some responsibility in this area, particularly in the reform of the laws on so-called economic redundancies. In no case should a flourishing business shed staff, let alone make employees redundant. Then there is the responsibility of the European Union. In January last year, our Parliament amended the Directive on informing and consulting workers. We are still waiting for the Commission to adopt these amendments. But I think that today we must go further. To give some examples, a six-month delay for any restructuring plan should be imposed on businesses in order to allow an independent assessment by the unions. If the company has received public funds, as has already been said, including European funds, non-compliance with the rules as laid down should entail the funds being paid back. By the same token, in the Directive on European works councils, the role of these councils as well as the protection of the staff delegates should be appreciably strengthened. It is therefore up to the Commission to submit two revised proposals for a directive to us as quickly as possible. Finally, on the eve of the opening of the WTO negotiations, I want to stress the need for Europe to state its political desires, including those related to industrial policy, focusing on employment, wealth creation and regional development. In the face of new technologies and the information revolution, there is room for a new concept of productivity, based not on the rationing of social expenditure but on the promotion of human abilities. Contrary to the current tendency to deregulate everything, the European Union can, if it wants, provide itself with instruments which will allow it to promote just such a policy, from the taxation of speculative transactions to the establishment of selective credit which will stimulate job creation and discourage mass redundancies. For its part, my Group will be addressing the main European trade union organisations in order to exchange views and, if needs be, initiate a European petition which will allow our fellow citizens to weigh up the forthcoming decisions. There has been a Vilvorde effect, the scope of which everyone remembers but which has not been reflected in new rules. We hope that the Michelin effect will instead result in concrete changes. I think that this is the standard against which our fellow citizens, faced with the kind of restructuring we are debating today, will judge the real extent of our solidarity.
costep_2010-01-19_4_34	Mr President, I find it odd that people here have spoken of visibility and have doubted the motives of the United States of America, because right now help is needed. I think that it is especially tragic that among the ruins at the moment, there are people who could still be rescued. Everything that can be done to improve the situation should be done. When, a while ago, the crisis management forces were established to bolster the European’s foreign and security policy, including its defence policy, the reason I was given for this, at least in Finland, was that these forces were also there in the event of natural disasters, and that they could help when such catastrophes struck anywhere in the world, including Europe of course. Now, however, crisis management forces actually have nothing to do in the different parts of Europe in which they are stationed. They have nothing to do. Fortunately, there are no crises in Europe, and so they have nothing to do. What is stopping these crisis management forces from being used for crises like this if help is being requested?
costep_2005-01-27_1_42	As we commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, we remember and condemn the horrific tragedy of the Holocaust. We cannot, and must not, forget this tragedy, which is one of the most shameful and painful chapters in our continent’s history. Let it serve as a lesson to all of us for the future, so that we can combat the extremes that lead to intolerance, discrimination and racism. I support the idea that the 27th should become the day on which, throughout Europe, we remember the Holocaust and pay tribute to its victims. I am concerned at the growing signs of anti-Semitism and racism, and at the rise of extremist and xenophobic parties. It is up to the EU and the international community as a whole, fully and effectively to promote and protect civil and fundamental rights in the Union and in the world. The EU must remain faithful to the values that form part of its shared heritage, must strive to safeguard the principles of tolerance and non-discrimination and must promote social, economic and political integration. It is crucial that we resume discussions on the draft framework decision on racism and xenophobia, because we will only be able to combat these phenomena effectively and consistently throughout EU territory if we adopt an integrated approach that involves both preventative and punitive measures.
costep_2010-03-09_5_27	Mr President, four final points. The first is that it is regrettable that the Council’s chair is empty during this debate. The second is to thank Commissioner Malmström for her kind remarks and also to ask her, together with the Council, to guarantee the entry into force of this regulation on 5 April. Otherwise we shall have a legal loophole, with consequences for real people. The third point is that it is regrettable that the Members who have participated here in the debate and who have raised the issue of security problems have not been able to recognise the improvements which Parliament has introduced by means of this regulation, in particular, the obligation to consult the Schengen Information System in advance. As I emphasised in my initial statement, I believe that Parliament has performed its task well because it has strengthened both freedom of movement and security. Not to recognise this means looking at it in a one-sided way, and not seeing the whole picture. My final point, Mr President, is to thank all those who have worked together towards this aim, namely those who allowed us to have an agreement on first reading, particularly the Commission and the Council, but also all those political groups within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Justice Committee who made this broad consensus possible. I believe that when we participate in finding a solution in this manner, we are performing our work in the best possible way.
costep_2011-06-23_14_537	The Consumer Rights Directive will enable full harmonisation of the rights of European consumers. This vote is the fruit of two years of discussions with consumer and professional associations, and it is, in particular, a major victory for the European Parliament which remained united around this issue. This text provides for new, very important regulations for e-commerce. We have set up a system which will make it possible to ensure that any order meets the wishes of the consumer (chief characteristics of the good or service, total cost, length of contract) prior to its definitive validation. With these new regulations, vendors will still be under the obligation to display clearly the total cost of the good or service including all additional costs. Thus consumers will be better and fully informed.
costep_2002-06-12_3_179	Madam President, what is happening with the agriculture dossier in the negotiations for accession is a clear example of the insistence on pursuing a process of enlargement on the basis of a Community financial framework that does not guarantee the principle of economic and social cohesion, given that the financial framework of Agenda 2000 was only designed for six candidates - whereas there are now ten - with a per capita income of around 40% of the European Union average. This situation affects farming, in particular, because of the well-known weaknesses of a sector which is important for employment and the economy of various candidate countries. The situation has a considerable socio-economic impact on the candidate countries, entails additional costs and also requires a revision of the financial perspectives in order to ensure that it is not the most badly affected or least developed countries that foot the bill. This is why dividing Member States into first and second class when it comes to aid is unacceptable, as are quotas that fall well short of their capacities and needs. The consequences of this situation would be an increase in unemployment and poverty - something we cannot accept. Rural development and the protection of a high-quality farm production system require a revision of the CAP and not the renationalisation of its costs, which would harm not only the farmers of those countries but also the farmers of countries such as Portugal, whose system of farming is more vulnerable.
costep_2001-05-17_5_53	This report deals with a problem of the greatest importance for the future well-being of workers in the European Union, for whom it is necessary to guarantee safe and sustainable pension systems for the long term. Now as is well known, there has been no lack of catastrophic visions for the future of social protection, based on the ageing of the population and increased life expectancy. Although the report does not distance itself enough from the more negative positions of the Commission, particularly when it refers to the need for greater flexibility in pension systems, it does highlight the importance of the rise in the employment rate and of public systems based on intergenerational solidarity, and a fair balance between proportional contributions and benefits, on the one hand, and the principle of solidarity, on the other, in order to prevent poverty and social exclusion. It also takes up the 1992 recommendation concerning the minimum income to be guaranteed by the social protection systems, by supporting initiatives for its implementation. However, the report does not go far enough regarding what needs to be put into practice in terms of economic and social policies so as to effectively ensure that public systems are sound enough and guarantee worthwhile pensions. For that reason, I abstained.
costep_2001-10-01_5_10	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Alexander de Roo on his tenacity in the fight against noise pollution. Noise pollution is very disturbing and can form a threat to health. Health is tied in with the environment and with the way in which we pollute the environment. The Sixth Environmental Action Programme is right to devote much attention to this aspect. This attention must lead to specific measures. The guiding principle is to reduce noise to a level at which it does not threaten public health. In this connection, the guidelines and opinions of the World Health Organisation should be taken into consideration. Noise pollution is local and certainly does not transcend borders. Solutions must be found by local, regional and national administrators. We should be careful not to regulate too much at EU level. Excessive ruling from Brussels is in most countries not appreciated - with good reason - but in few cases, European attention is certainly justified. First of all, Europe must step in when the noise source exceeds limits, for example in the form of products. There are already European rules in place for noise pollution, for example pertaining to the noise standards for lawnmowers. Noise emission standards for certain products, such as cars, pleasure boats, lorries, trains, aircraft and industrial equipment are essential. A second reason for European intervention is the making available of reliable and verifiable data. The European Parliament pointed at the lack of data on various sources of noise a long time ago, and a common method must be found for measuring and assessing noise. And this forms the very essence of the Commission’s proposal. Thirdly, general principles must be formulated, such as: the polluter, or noise-maker, pays. This kind of principle must be transposed in our legislation. Citizens must - and that is, in fact, the most important point, in my opinion - have clear rights. In the case of serious complaints about noise pollution, the right to investigation should exist and, if necessary, action should be taken.
costep_1998-09-17_7_60	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again this summer a large number of huge forest fires hit various southern European countries including Portugal. First of all, of course, we should think of the victims and call for Community aid. Apart from the call in the resolution for the Commission to earmark the necessary budgetary amounts, the European Parliament ought also to look into the advantages of creating its own budgetary line for assistance in cases of disasters. We are aware that some of these fires are of criminal origin while others are the result of climatic changes leading to lengthy droughts and heatwaves. It is therefore vital to pay more attention to prevention, and greater support will be needed from the European institutions to help increase efficiency in fighting forest fires. For example, the common agricultural policy could help to prevent these disasters, and a European forestry strategy is also something we should look at. It was supported by the European Parliament when it approved the Thomas report. For all of these reasons, along with other colleagues we back this motion for a resolution and seek the support of the European Parliament as a whole.
costep_2000-03-29_2_8	Madam President, I would like to inform the House of an incident which occurred at a joint meeting between the European Parliament Delegation for relations with Canada and its Canadian counterpart, which was here on a visit last week. Mr Sturdy, the chairman of our delegation, was unable to attend at that precise time, Madam President, but he has written to you this morning to confirm what I am about to say. Something quite astonishing for this type of meeting occurred. The chairman of the Canadian delegation suddenly launched into the most obnoxious personal attacks upon myself, for no reason whatsoever, to the point that the other members of his delegation spoke up to disassociate themselves from his words. Everyone was quite dumbfounded by this attitude. This is regrettable in the extreme, since this was an otherwise excellent visit, and because we wish to maintain the best relations with Canada, after so many difficult years, principally due to conflicts over fishing. It is imperative to restore good relations, and we therefore deplore this incident most strongly. Madam President, I should like you to ask the Canadian government for some explanation of the significance of these declarations.
costep_2000-04-12_4_9	Madam President, the IGC should prepare the EU for the reorganisation needed to bring about the complete process of enlargement that is in hand. The most important consideration regarding enlargement in the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report is increased flexibility. Only differentiation within the EU can create the preconditions necessary for enlargement on such a massive scale. It is important that the report proposes that closer cooperation should be facilitated. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has recommended that the principle of flexibility should also be realised in the form of greater scope for cooperation for those countries that cannot or do not want to accept the Union’s statutes in their entirety. This would facilitate and speed up enlargement of the Union. In making its review the Group of the Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party states that flexibility might lead to a larger concentric Europe, composed of a federal core and a less integrated outer circle. At this stage it is not necessary to adopt a precise position on how the Union should be differentiated. It is enough for now that we create an institutional framework in which it is possible to deepen and expand the Union in practical terms. I hope that Amendment No 154, which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled regarding increased flexibility, will be adopted.
costep_2006-12-12_18_38	The outcome of the vote on the Television without Frontiers Directive shows great maturity on the part of Parliament. In fact, thanks to the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, of all the draftsmen of opinions, of the Council and of the Commission, the directive provides an effective tool for promoting the competitiveness of the European audiovisual industry, leaving reasonable scope for private funding (this is nothing new, audiovisual services live off advertising) while guaranteeing an appropriate level of protection for consumers and, above all, for the most vulnerable members of society (such as children and the disabled). I would, however, have preferred more courage to have been shown, for example regarding the introduction of product placement. While I agree with those who wish to safeguard the creativity and independence of writers, together with the quality of productions, I must nevertheless point out that, in 2007, and on the international market, this practice is a reality, and denying this fact means risking a loss of competitiveness, funding and market quotas. I hope that the majority of the Member States will be able to show more courage and more openmindedness than these institutions have so far shown.
costep_1998-11-16_4_6	Mr President, I am speaking here on behalf of Mr Giansily who has been detained at another meeting. In spite of the serious and expert work carried out by Mr Fabra Vallés, we find the report on the repercussions of the MED programmes affair highly unsatisfactory. In fact, we believe that, far from clarifying the debate on the 1996 discharge, this report only makes the issue more confusing. The irregularities discovered in the management of the MED programmes, which meant that these programmes were suspended until the Commission relaunched them in April, involve more than a third of the appropriations used and the financial loss is much greater than was first supposed. As the rapporteur has clearly shown, the management of the MED programmes shows evidence of serious management problems for which the Commission is entirely responsible and for which it must accept the consequences, as provided for in the Treaties. This whole matter falls within the framework of the discharge procedure, which will be on the agenda in December. The instruments the European Parliament has at its disposal to mark its disapproval, or to punish the Commission, are the refusal to grant discharge and even the censure procedure. Further debate, in my view, is likely to weaken Parliament’s position in the vote in December and I regret the fact that consideration of the MED programmes is not an integral part of the general report by Mr Elles on the discharge. Secondly, the petition to the Commission in the rapporteur’s resolution is of little use when the European Parliament should judge the Commission on its financial auditing rather than following it through the maze of its administrative inquiries that are not sufficiently transparent. It is unfortunate that the rapporteur has not included any mention of the link between the irregularities discovered and the refusal to grant discharge, which is, however, at the heart of the debate. For our part, we are hoping for an objective debate on the discharge for the 1996 financial year. We hope, on the one hand, that genuine and frank questions will be asked regarding the irregularities and the fraud committed in the implementation of the MED programmes, for which responsibility lies with the Commission. And we hope, on the other hand, that Parliament shows no sign of weakness in exercising the powers of which it is guardian on behalf of Europe’s citizens because, when all is said and done, is it not our citizens who have been deceived in this affair?
costep_2006-12-12_18_37	It is important to promote the free movement of European television programmes and for the production of these programmes not to be hindered by excessively strict legislation on advertising. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is opting for a realistic look on product placement. Information is useful, but consumers are not waiting for a reminder during a television programme. A reminder prior to and after a programme are sufficient. Income from advertising and product placement is needed in order to help finance European productions; the alternative to that is even more cheap American ones, full of product placement. Children’s programmes must be subject to stricter standards, for obesity is an increasing problem. Given the huge impact of advertising of unhealthy food on children’s menu choices, advertising directed at this target group should be restricted. I would therefore argue in favour of developing an effective code of conduct with regard to advertising, product placement and other marketing of unhealthy drinks and food aimed at children. Finally, I would still advocate a strong country of origin principle. Television programme makers should not be made subject to extra rules and regulations when they want to offer their programmes elsewhere in the European Union. What we must do is enhance the sales of European audiovisual products.
costep_2002-07-04_4_32	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication we are debating today contains the strategy by means of which the European Union attempts to make a contribution to social development. It is positive that this is being done. Many fear that in the era of globalisation, social development will be compromised. These days, the bodies that reach agreements are further removed from the average citizen, and become anonymous for that reason alone. This anonymity leads to discomfort and unrest. Indeed, the citizen who is positively disposed towards this society has no way of gaining an overall picture. The Commission has mapped out the relations between the different players in the global society in a clear and readily understood format. It has listed the mechanisms whereby the European Union, the ILO and the WTO, commit themselves to the promotion of fundamental labour standards and to improving social governance. As draftsman of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, I have to tell you that, in our view, the communication does not specifically consider the gender dimension as part of fundamental labour standards and of the acquisition of social sustainability. It is true that gender forms part of the ILO’s core labour standards because the non-discrimination principle and the principle of equal treatment are, after all, enshrined in it. However, we know that the best economic and social development is that in which women are definitely involved 100%. This is, in fact, the reason why the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities proposes to incorporate studies on the gender dimension as an instrument. I should also like to draw your attention to the fact that, where the topic of social partners is discussed, the role of women’s organisations is not considered. This is a failing, because not only within the EU, but also outside it, women are still not being involved enough via the traditional routes to be able to help shape policy. By way of conclusion, I want to make an urgent appeal to the Commission to improve the excellent communication that is before us with the studies on the gender dimension. This will give a better insight into the important role to be played by women in social development, and I want to thank Mrs Gillig warmly, not only for her sterling report but certainly also for the way in which she has joined forces with the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities.
costep_2007-06-18_15_40	The debate on the Regulation on spirits has culminated in an issue which the Commission pooh-poohed in its proposal: the equal treatment of vodka alongside other strong drinks. It would be more accurate to say, however, this is about the equal treatment of European cultures. Apart from the fact that the debate on now reminds us of the existence of a European multiculture, it also at the same time shows that there is still much work to be done in the name of unity which respects differences. The definition of vodka we are wrangling with is in fact a technical amendment to something we already knew about and found to be good: for centuries vodka has been manufactured almost entirely from grain and potatoes. In the EU 90% of all vodka has also been produced from these raw materials. When it comes to defining the ingredients, it is therefore not just a question of the interests of manufacturers and artificial market barriers, but of tradition. The vodka-producing countries, in which 70% of vodka is produced and consumed, do actually know what they are talking about. The compromise by the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, which in practice would permit the manufacture of vodka from any agricultural product, as long as there is a small mention of it on the label at the back, is inadequate. If we have to end up with a compromise, it should give greater support to the traditional manufacturing method. The EU’s common identity and the legislation that supports that notion must be built on mutual respect, where historical facts are recognised. Our current legislation on spirits is from a time when the vodka-producing countries were not members of the EU, and so it needs to be updated. During the accession negotiations which Finland, Sweden, and countries which joined the Union later on, such as Poland, were involved in, the definition of vodka was passed over and promises were made to put that right in the near future. Now is that time.
costep_2006-04-27_1_83	Europe’s main priority, in my view, should be at regional level. The EU has a duty towards the citizens of its Member States, and as a member of the international community, to play a unique role in its immediate sphere of influence. There is a place, and a need, however, for this to be extended to other areas of influence, and that naturally includes Latin America. For historical, cultural and linguistic reasons, this is an area with huge potential for developing political and economic cooperation and, more importantly, international relations, where collaboration between those on both sides of the Atlantic could be extremely advantageous. Lastly, I wish to make a point from a Portuguese perspective. Whilst Portugal has a duty to make Africa one of its priority areas in foreign policy, it must not overlook the importance of transatlantic ties. It must therefore give full support to initiatives such as the summit to be held in Vienna on 12 and 13 May. I therefore hope that this summit will produce a positive outcome, with particular regard to the negotiations with Mercosur, an issue to which I have on a number of occasions displayed my concern and commitment.
costep_1997-03-10_3_15	Mr President, you mentioned just now the unanimous support of all the groups for the position you adopted during your visit to Paris. I must ask you to note that this unanimity cannot include the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations. You did indeed do what a president of the European Parliament logically must do, and reflected the will of the majority. Nevertheless, I would remind all those who make ringing declarations on the importance of Parliament’s activities that this famous - and umpteenth - resolution on racism and xenophobia was adopted on that memorable Thursday afternoon by 106 votes to 101, and that in actual fact, by expressing its opinion as it does on Thursday afternoons about a more and more varied and less and less carefully considered range of subjects, the European Parliament undermines its own credibility. What the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Hervé de Charette, said merely echoed what might be thought by any objective observer of the European Parliament who studies the content of its resolutions. The fact is that Parliament sees fit to express an opinion on any subject at all. It did so that afternoon, despite the fact that a national parliament, which is the expression of State sovereignty, the incarnation of democratic legitimation, the representative of an entire national population, was debating that issue. It did so although it had no jurisdiction in the matter. The position expressed, you should know, reflects the point of view of a great many European citizens. I believe, Mr President, that we should learn another lesson from this incident, as well as the one pointed out by Mr Nordmann, which I endorse. We should ensure that texts that appear on Thursday afternoon’s agenda are carefully prepared and concern Parliament’s areas of responsibility. In following the procedure you know about, especially on the occasion of the visit here by the French Head of State, Parliament will have encouraged several countries, including France, to refuse to extend the powers of a Parliament that does not deserve them.
costep_2010-03-09_7_16	Madam President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the initiative and trust that it can help people and companies at national level. However, without clear and strictly regulated monitoring of the situation of the internal market and legal system, I doubt whether it will be possible to effectively save these market players, regardless of their size and the services used. Strict penalties must be laid down if, following an analysis, obvious violations are found. Practices absolutely must be observed when investigating complaints at international level and to lay down criteria. Unfortunately, the sad statistics in my state show that in eight out of ten international cases currently being investigated, State institutions or courts are found to have acted improperly. Therefore, I think that without the clear regulation of penalties, it will be impossible to achieve the desired result. I would like attention to be drawn to this.
costep_2000-07-05_15_2	Mr President, Commissioner, one of the EU’s key goals is to promote mobility within the labour market, and this can only be stimulated by high-quality education. It is therefore essential to develop tools not only to improve education, but also to ensure that education meets modern-day requirements. Quality assessment, self-assessment of schools in particular, is a key element in the development of quality education. This is why, all in all, I am delighted with the Commission’s recommendation that is now before us. However, I also have some comments with regard to the recommendation, and I included these in my report. In my opinion, it is especially important to encourage Member States to develop sound methods for assessment in education, bearing in mind that self-assessment is complementary to external evaluation. In addition, it is important for them to exchange good models and experiences and that all those involved in the school are actually involved in the self-assessment process, including parents and students. Moreover, it is important to stimulate cooperation between schools and various bodies, also at local and regional level. Good examples of this can be found in the trial projects and also, of course, at European level. What the Commission needs to do, therefore, is to draw up an inventory of sound existing methods, in order to set up a database which can be used interactively so that activities can be scheduled and regular reports submitted to Parliament by putting the item on the running agenda. I have drawn on many ideas from my fellow delegates, but also from many institutions in the sphere I mentioned above. It transpired in the process that the will to turn this project into a success is present on all sides, and the impetus created by the EU has certainly found fertile soil. It is therefore all the more unfortunate that repeated attempts on my part to reach agreement with the Council - because you know it was my intention to complete the report at first reading - were thwarted time and again and met with reactions that came too late and insufficient mandate. I would therefore call on the Council to come up with a proposal for a common position within the short term. We are nearly there, but I would first of all like to clarify the line adopted by our Parliament, so that we can coincide with the line taken by the Council. Finally, we reached general agreement in the committee on a large number of amendments. I thank you all for your very constructive attitude. I would now ask you for your support to deliver on these agreements. I would advise you not to pursue the amendments tabled by the PSE. It is important to couple education with the labour market. This is borne out by the results reached in Lisbon. After all, we should not educate people for unemployment, and education needs to pre-empt this. This is why this should also be included in this report. The other amendments are already more or less reflected in the text or in other amendments. Finally, I would like to mention the financial dimension. I have not made any changes on purpose, not because I think the budget is generous but because I think that it will appear from the reports whether the budget is too tight. That will then be a good time to consider a possible increase in the funding. I thank you and look forward to your reactions.
costep_2006-02-15_1_114	The situation in Belarus, with just over a month remaining until the elections, leaves little hope that the Presidential Elections in this country will be democratic, free or fair. As yet, not one single candidate is registered officially, and only one future candidate (the current President Alexander Lukashenko) is the subject of an intense propaganda campaign, which is being carried out by the entire state media. Press analysis shows that an opinion is being formed nationwide that there is no alternative to the current President, and that an absolute majority of citizens will vote for him because only Alexander Lukashenko can guarantee stability in a country whose achievements are unquestionable. Apparently, the President’s opponents are useless scoundrels, while the West does not understand the situation in Belarus and seeks to destabilise the country, but will be unable to do so because Belarus has President Lukashenko. Repression of the non-state media continues to intensify. Within this context European Union support is a vital necessity, but it is insufficient, late and therefore has little effect. Is this really all the European Union can do to defend freedom of thought and the press in a neighbouring country?!
costep_2010-04-21_7_23	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Takkula has just said, cyanide technology is a common method in mining. However, as we have heard, it is highly dangerous. The disaster that Mrs Băsescu just mentioned contaminated the Danube at the time and shocked us all, and you know that I campaign strongly for the Danube region. For that reason, as a trade politician, I wonder what can we do about it? In the European Union, we only have limited gold mining capacities. The goal is to make a difference worldwide with technical innovations. Here, there is high technology, I know. In Germany environmental technologies were developed that will help to avoid cyanide in the future. We must make these European high technologies commercially viable and we must make them affordable. I see great potential for trade in this. We should not confine ourselves to the European Union, but ensure that here, we also achieve a breakthrough in international trade, in the interests of the environment and our economy.
costep_2010-10-20_7_167	In the face of an ageing population and the difficulties with which the European economy is dealing, we have to use all opportunities available to us to encourage women to have children and to make it easy for them to return to work. Many women are eminent specialists in their fields, and Europe’s economy cannot do without the services of this highly qualified workforce. The situation is similar with women living and working in the countryside. Often, they are not given maternity leave in the full meaning of the word, but have to return to work as soon as possible. This obviously puts both their health and their child in jeopardy. That is why they should have the same privileges as women working outside agriculture.
costep_2009-10-08_5_31	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to rationalise an apparently ambiguous feeling that I have after this first stage of the debate, because I fully subscribe to the strong words spoken by my chairman, Mr Daul, but I also subscribe to the words of Mr Sassoli who should, by all rights, be a political opponent of mine. Let me explain myself better: am I schizophrenic for having such ambivalent feelings, or am I trying unnecessarily to reconcile the fact that, in Italy, I sit on the opposition benches while, here, I find myself next to the People of Freedom party, in the People’s Party? I feel I can answer that by highlighting an obvious contrast between the scope and the importance of the subject of freedom of information, which is a very important subject Were Montesquieu alive today, he would have spoken not only of legislative, executive and judicial powers, but of other powers too, and he would have put the fourth power, the press, in first place, as it represents a problem of freedom, of the fight against mental slavery, and a problem of democracy. On the other hand, the straw that broke the camel’s back after months and months of barbarisation of the entire Italian press - let it be said - of the right and of the left; the quality of the Italian press has been poor for months now because politics really has reached a low point - was Mr Berlusconi’s legal action. Please indulge me: I was a criminal judge for four years in the Fifth criminal division of the Court of Cassation, where we judged the crime of libel. This is how I know Mr Mauro is right: I saw many of these actions for libel, and no one protested. Citizens have the right to defend themselves in these situations too. I therefore hope that, by making a genuine attempt to reconcile seemingly opposing points, we will actually come up with a new and better way of tackling the problem for the whole of Europe and not just in regard to Italy.
costep_2003-06-03_2_99	Taking advantage of the fact that, as a result of the Nice Treaty, the Council’s decision on the 'Statute for Members of the European Parliament' must now be taken under qualified majority voting rather than unanimity, the EP is once again insisting on a proposal that contains aspects with which we disagree. One such aspect concerns setting a monthly parliamentary allowance that is the same for all Members, regardless of which country they represent. Members of the EP are elected in national constituencies. Consequently, they are, and must remain, bound to these constituencies. Establishing a single monthly allowance fits in with a federalist view of the mandate of an EP Member, by seeking to transform today’s national Members of the EP into future 'European MPs'. This is a vision that we do not share. Furthermore, as we have emphasised, the social realities in the countries of the EU differ greatly, making it inevitable that if this measure is implemented, in various countries, including Portugal, there will be enormous inequalities and disparities between the pay of workers and that of representatives and holders of public office, which would be quite incomprehensible. In other words, the salary of Members of the EP must be based on the salary of the Members of the national parliament of the country in which they are elected. Hence our vote against the report.
costep_2001-11-14_2_13	Mr President, the amount of EUR 17.5 billion of EU membership funds will be used in the next few years on scientific activities through the framework programme. The size of this sum indicates how significant the matter in question now is. Codecision procedure removes power from the Commission and brings it to Parliament. In this matter it is particularly well-founded. There are good grounds to support Mr Caudron’s model on programme coordination and administration as well as informing and listening to Parliament in decision-making at levels more detailed than that of the framework programme. The primary research areas selected by the Commission are well-founded as are also Parliament’s complementary priorities, which are not all mere information technology and artificial intelligence. The health of a human being depends on what he eats. It is justified to use funds to research the whole of the food chain. The new biotechnology involves the ethical foundations of all kinds of life, and therefore technology must also be complemented by results from human sciences. Science must not be dependent on the ethics of big corporations, and that is why it must receive public funding. When the health of the environment depends greatly on energy production, several adjustments made by Parliament endeavour to improve the research into new forms of energy. It would be justified to direct more funds into the research of fusion energy than what the Commission is proposing. There is need to build a new Tokamak for the joint use of all Member States and Switzerland, Canada, Japan and Russia. When funding is cut, this important project is delayed, further delaying the opportunity to produce energy by fusion power, which even in the current circumstances is going to be postponed by as much as fifty years. When the framework programme was drawn up, not enough attention was paid to the activities of the Joint Research Centre of the EU. It will also use scientific resources. During the coming five-year period its position within the research community of the EU and its Member States must be clarified; research resources must not be wasted.
costep_1998-12-14_7_8	Mr President, the question of what holds together the innermost part of the world is not a very original one as it is very old. It is however more relevant than ever, because of course our social development is moulded by many different factors, together making up what we call the European development model. To that extent, it is crucially important with respect to our future development for us to ask at this point what really holds our society together in the innermost part, and then to tie that in to research activities in all sectors. That is why I very much welcome the fact that we have here a specific programme that supports the mobility of researchers and focuses on socio-economic research, particularly with regard to the innermost part of our society. This delicate plant was produced by Parliament and began to bloom in the fourth framework research programme. There were many problems and excesses, the strategic direction could have been better, but in the last few years it has improved considerably and the last call, the third one, was excellent. At this point I would also like to praise Director Mitsos from the Commission, who really handled it well. Praising the Commission is something we ought to do once in a while these days! Nonetheless, I have taken the liberty of proposing improvements on seven points. Firstly, in the provisional allocation of funds, it is foreseen that only 10 % is to be made available for socio-economic research. I think that in our provisional allocation we could easily fix the figure a little higher, as the areas of responsibility have increased somewhat within the framework of the conciliation procedure under the fifth framework research programme. I would therefore suggest a provisional figure of 15 %. Secondly, I think it is important for us to know about the mobility and research content of the programme. Transparency must be ensured, in particular by using the Internet, with regard to the participating institutions and the themes. Thirdly, I think it important that socio-economic research is not just carried out as a sideline, but is connected horizontally to the other research areas. That is why there are some proposals - Amendment No 37 in particular - for greater coordination of this research with other research areas. Fourthly, I would like to mention some small improvements with relation to content. These involve structural changes, particularly as regards the ageing of our society, the effects of structural changes on employment and people’s mentalities in our society, and the forms of participation. In many areas it turns out that participation is no longer taking place in traditional policy areas, but more in non-governmental organisations, citizens' initiatives and so on. These aspects should also be reflected in the content. Fifthly, of course, the networking of researchers is also important. I do not want to take up the cudgels for social science research, but I sometimes have the feeling that European cooperation has not yet developed very far in the area and a little help could still be given to establishing a European research network. This is also important of course when it comes to making applications. The creation of a network ought therefore to be supported. My sixth point concerns support for equality of opportunity, also where participation in this research programme is concerned. It cannot be acceptable for instance that time spent bringing up children is not taken into account when the Marie Curie fellowships are awarded. That point has to be clarified, as indeed does overall support for equality of opportunity. Last week I attended a symposium where there were 150 participants, and only two of them were women. There is obviously room for improvement here. My seventh and final point is that we also have to promote the results. It is of no help at all to have good studies if they are lying in a drawer. In the area of the social sciences especially, this often happens. The results should be promoted on the Internet, for example, but should also be transferred directly to the users, the politicians, in this Parliament, in the national Parliaments, and presented on the ground, in order to make them useful in the social process.
costep_2001-01-16_12_24	Mr President, the socio-economic importance of the fishing industry is well known, not only for the jobs that it creates directly and indirectly, but also for the economic development of many fishing regions and communities, including the small coastal fishing sector that ensures the European Union’s supply of fresh fish and the preservation of its traditions and cultures. Nevertheless, as has been confirmed at regional conferences, there is profound criticism of the common fisheries policy, both with regard to the TAC system and quotas and with regard to the system of Multiannual Guidance Programmes, which have led to discrimination and have not brought any major benefits to the industry. This makes it essential that Member States which have achieved their objectives should not be penalised through further reductions of their fishing effort whilst other countries have not achieved the objectives laid down in previous MAGPs. It has also become clear that most of those working in the fishing industry harbour doubts about scientific opinions on the management and conservation of fish products, although they do not question the need to conserve species. What is needed, therefore, is a thorough review of the common fisheries policy, involving fishermen and other interested parties in the decision-making process, to ensure that their experience and knowledge can contribute to the creation of a more workable and realistic system. We need appropriate structural measures to guarantee the survival of communities dependent on fishing and socio-economic measures that improve the standard of living of fishermen, who must not suffer as a result of possible measures to protect species, as has happened to the sardine fishermen in the north of Portugal. We must also take account of the specific nature of the outermost regions and it is particularly important, as the Gallagher report states, that we move towards extending the exclusion zone to 24 miles, which is, in fact, something on which Parliament has already taken a decision. With regard to current negotiations in the World Trade Organisation, it must be emphasised, as it is in the Varela SuanzesCarpegna report, that Community fishing activity cannot be analysed from a purely economic angle based on trade in goods. Fishing in the European Union is multifunctional in nature; it contributes towards the integration of the social and economic fabric of coastal areas, representing a way of life and a factor for cohesion in large areas along our coastline, while at the same time guaranteeing food supply. I also wish, Mr President, to mention international fishing agreements, which have a fundamental role in supplying the European market by means of the European fishing fleet. What is of particular concern, however, is the information that we have received not only on the delay in the fishing agreements with Angola, but also on the difficulties in renewing the fishing agreement with Morocco. We need more than just a rehashed explanation. What we need is the adoption of measures that will guarantee the protection of fishermen and the rights of shipowners who are caught up in this situation, as is currently happening in Portugal.
costep_2003-05-12_1_58	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a directive which has involved complicated, extensive and heated debates within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy in particular. We have tried to stress that cogeneration is not an end in itself but an energy efficiency measure and that this proposal, which pursues the Commission’s strategy of increasing energy efficiency in the European Union, was well received but at the same time presented a series of problems, as the rapporteur, Mr Glante, pointed out at the outset. Then, by means of close dialogue and debate between various members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we presented a balanced proposal which was genuinely significant from the point of view of energy savings. As I said before, cogeneration based on heat demand will therefore allow us to optimise the situation in terms of greenhouse gases and balance the functioning of the electrical system. However, this whole building could have fallen down upon us if we had promoted an unnecessary demand for heat. Too simplistic an approach - such as the one I believe was proposed initially - would have led us to promote the construction of cogeneration plants without there being any real heat demand. And this would have been contrary to what we believed the objective of this proposal to be. I would like to congratulate Mr Glante and everybody who has participated in the various meetings which have taken place on this issue, because it was not an easy issue to understand. They include my colleague, Mr Vidal-Quadras, who has worked courageously on this directive. We have been through numbers, formulae, variables and subscripts and I believe we have finally managed to bring our points of view closer together. The compromise amendments represent good progress in terms of reaching a final agreement and it is significant that the existence of different technologies throughout the length and breadth of the European Union has been recognised. It is the case that the more heat a plant produces, the greater the global efficiency of the cogeneration process. But to reduce the whole directive to this statement is simplistic and unrealistic. A plant for the exclusive production of heat with an efficiency of 80% is entirely inefficient - I would even go as far as to say obsolete - but a plant for the production of electricity with an efficiency of 50% may be very efficient. And why is all of this the case? For the simple reason that electricity is a more elaborate form of energy which is obtained from heat. Once it is made clear that the global efficiency of the plant is not an appropriate or absolute parameter for determining the value of cogeneration, what are we left with? We are left - as I believe Mr Vidal-Quadras will also point out - with primary energy savings and consequently gas emissions savings. This is the most appropriate parameter for measuring the benefits derived from cogeneration, when compared to the separate production of heat and electricity. We must not forget an important point: that cogeneration has been developed in the different Member States according to cultural traditions. In the countries of the Centre and the North of Europe heat for municipal uses predominates, and it is obvious that heating and hot water needs are enormous during much of the year; in other latitudes a form of cogeneration in which the proportion of heat is lower has developed for obvious reasons, and therefore electricity for industrial uses predominates. The remainder is sold on the network. Mr Glante has been able to see that this proposal required a profound analysis before reaching definitive conclusions. However, as draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I must say that this was not the case in this committee and that the opinion it approved, in the light of what is being proposed today, following the debates and meetings which have taken place, lacks realism and rigour. The complexity of this issue was demonstrated a moment ago and I, as rapporteur supported by my group, requested a more flexible timetable. In other words, I asked that this proposal be debated seriously and that there might be more time to compare our differing opinions with the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. This request was denied and the proposal was voted on in a hurried fashion with the result that I am now describing. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, amongst all of us, we must try to prevent situations such as this. An opinion cannot be drawn up in the way it has been drawn up in the case of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on cogeneration, which I fear is not an isolated case since it happens relatively often in Parliament. Finally, I believe we have produced a rigorous, proportionate and necessary proposal. I would therefore congratulate the rapporteur once again, and my colleagues in the Industry Committee, on their excellent work, and particularly on not accepting the first proposal and fighting to reach agreements on a proposal which satisfies everybody. Congratulations, Commissioner.
costep_2004-07-21_1_49	Mr President, one quarter of the Netherlands is below sea-level so you have a long history of trying to keep dry! I suspect that your presidency will be about digging channels and containing the tides - tides such as the challenge of funding the new enlarged European Union, the deepening importance of rebuilding our economic strength, the ebb and flow of the dangers of international terrorism. You need to inherit some of the momentum of your predecessor, without being caught in its shadow. The Irish presidency has passed one crucial legacy to yours: the European constitution. Liberals and Democrats in this House will lead the way in campaigning for the constitution and we expect every one of Europe’s governments to be in the vanguard. If we cannot sell it, it was not worth a single glass of Justus Lipsius champagne. For the rest of the work that you have set, time is short. With the summer recess and a new Parliament and Commission rushing to find their feet, you must achieve in three-and-a-half months what many presidencies struggle to achieve in six. We look forward to working with the good team that you have in Mr Nicolaï and his colleagues. Liberals and Democrats in this House welcome your commitment to renewing the economic reform agenda. We agree that the need now is to focus more on better implementation and less on new regulation. The foundation of social cohesion in Europe is a strong and dynamic economy. With careful consideration for the needs of local and regional economies the single European market can be a tide that can lift all of our boats. An important part of this is the credibility of the euro and the eurozone. We joined your presidency in welcoming the principle at the heart of last week’s ruling by the European Court of Justice that a pact is a pact: that Member States cannot and should not break with impunity the rules they set for themselves. We will be watching closely to see that a rethought Stability Pact can command the respect of big and small states alike. We welcome your commitment to push ahead on the justice and home affairs agenda. We welcome the launch of a debate on the best way to integrate our migration controls, closing the door to illegal migration while protecting those who justly flee oppression. But we need qualified majority voting and codecision in asylum, immigration and judicial cooperation as provided for in Article 251 of the Treaty. My group also agrees that Member States have to work together better to tackle terrorism, but we remain suspicious of the Council’s intent to employ biometric identifiers widely. Too many of our questions about fallibility, cost-effectiveness and privacy have not been properly answered. You must not pre-empt the decisions of Parliament in these matters. Yours is also the presidency that will oversee the nomination of the new Commission. Last week my group asked the Commission President-designate to commit himself to striving for a better gender balance in the Commission. But in reality this is your job, Mr President-in-Office. Liberals and Democrats in this House want a Commission that is at least one-third women. We might remind you that if the gender balance of the Council reflected that of Europe itself, it would be thirteen to twelve. We need a debate on Turkey. Let us have that debate, openly and frankly. What we are committed to is hearing out the Commission when it makes its recommendation in November, and we expect the Council to do the same. Nor do we all agree on the correct level of funding for the European Union over the next seven years, but we do share a commitment to ensuring value for money and focusing on the Union’s key priorities. If this presidency can publish guidelines and principles for the negotiations in December we will have the basis for an intelligent debate on future financial perspectives. Liberals and Democrats share your realism, but we hope it comes with a ballast of ambition and vision. You must decide on questions which will define the future of our Union. Mr President-in-Office. We are relying on your leadership to keep this ship afloat and keep it steaming, just as impressively as Manet’s 'Steamboat Leaving Boulogne', which is on show at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.
costep_1997-01-15_4_26	Mr President, we all know that the WTO has a central role to play in the fair regulation of international trade relations. The holding of the Singapore Conference thus represents an undeniable advance, valuable in defining agreements that will help to move mankind forward in the right direction. But that conference has highlighted some very different approaches and concepts, especially as regards social standards. To think it sufficient to stress that problem in a final declaration and then go away with a clear conscience, or to believe that it is enough to refer the question to the ILO on the pretext that international trade and social rights should be kept separate, is irresponsible to say the least, especially bearing in mind the limitations of that institution’s power to act. I would call this a retreat forwards. Above all, it demonstrates the political desire of certain Union governments to submerge the question of social standards in the WTO. I take a very dim view of the Union’s failure to present a united front. We were not all singing from the same hymn book in this area, which played into the hands of certain developing countries. I take a very dim view of it because the Union could, and should, have done more to achieve the setting-up of a working group on social standards within the WTO. Mr President, I understand that it is not always easy to arrive at the best compromise at such difficult meetings as Singapore. But I find it shocking, and even pathetic, that developed countries could barter information technologies, whisky and brandy for the exploitation of millions of children who are being forced to work - work to death, in some cases - and whose numbers are still growing according to the ILO itself. You will understand my reaction, which is that humanity should take precedence over financial gain, a reaction that keeps faith with the values of democracy, solidarity and humanitarianism. My profound desire is that the Union should take strong action against any failure to respect human rights in the field of labour, and that it should not hesitate to take the necessary steps when specific illegal acts become known, as in Burma and elsewhere. So we have a choice. Either we succeed in introducing social standards into the WTO, or we shall see the proliferation of social struggles in countries regarded as politically and socially stable. What is happening in South Korea today should be seen as a grave warning.
costep_1999-11-04_5_24	Last week I expressed my view of the Michelin case and the absolute scandal of an otherwise prosperous firm proceeding with collective redundancies. Today I wish to express my view of the guidelines on employment for the year 2000. The Treaty of Amsterdam gives me this right, and I am taking advantage of it to say how important I think it is for the European Parliament to be formally consulted on this matter. It is not a matter of adding new guidelines at the present time, when the basic rules adopted in 1997 seem to be working well. It is rather a matter of amending them on the basis of the joint report on employment 1999, adapting them to the new socio-economic order. The report tells us that there has indeed been progress since 1998, as unemployment has dropped from 10.1% to 9.9% and there are 1.8 million more people in employment. But these positive figures must not obscure the serious inequalities and problems which still exist. Unemployment among young people, for instance, is around 20%! Half of the unemployed in the European Union are long-term unemployed. Many jobs are still insecure and 60 million people are living below the poverty line. It is therefore essential to give new impetus to employment strategy in Europe, and to set ambitious goals, such as reducing unemployment by half within five years. This can only be achieved by attacking on several fronts at the same time, using energetic, preventative and corrective methods. In particular, this requires reform and modernisation of education and training which must be of benefit to everyone, without discrimination based on social environment or on the individual, and which must take technological and IT developments into account, and a ferocious fight against all forms of unemployment and job insecurity. People must, at all costs, be prevented from getting used to being unemployed. The unemployed really need support, guidance and motivation in order to be reintegrated into employment. Imaginative measures must be found, which can be adapted to the diversity of the situations in different Member States and which respect the dignity of job seekers. But beware lest we fall into the trap which some policies create, claiming that, just because they are unemployed, people should take any job going on the grounds that it is better to have a job which is not secure than no job at all! The objective is to enable the unemployed to gain employment which is lasting, with full entitlement to their rights!
costep_2003-09-23_2_160	Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to say something about some of this Budget’s foreign policy aspects and will start by responding to Mr Poos, who said that the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is unacceptable in terms of the amount that it proposes for Iraq, as a UN mandate is required. Mr Poos has evidently not read this amendment, which takes as its reference value the resolution that this House will be adopting tomorrow, it being a minimum precondition for the European Union’s involvement in Iraq that there should be a UN resolution, that the money should be put in a trust fund controlled by the World Bank and the United Nations, that the Iraqi people should be involved in the processes of democratisation, in the adoption of a constitution and of the establishment of institutions, all of which are now needed, and, above all, that the oil industry should be placed in the hands of the United Nations, in order that it may be a source of funding for the country’s reconstruction. The budget allocation we have proposed is dependent on that condition, and, even if we are talking in terms of one single euro rather than five hundred million of them, it matters that we should get this general concept and these framework conditions right. From that point of view, the Budget today and Parliament’s resolution tomorrow must be seen as very closely interconnected. Secondly, if this leads us to say that we want to get the United Nations more involved, then we must give more attention to it and to our relations with it overall - and that is what Parliament and the Commission are currently working on. I believe it is tomorrow that the Italian Presidency of the Council is signing, in New York, an agreement on crisis management and crisis prevention, but this needs to be mentioned in the Budget. At present, our programmes for the United Nations are all shared out between a whole load of items in the Budget, without there having been a policy debate to set priorities. As an issue in this House, the subject of the United Nations has been dormant in recent years, and the Commission’s new document gives hope that we will now be defining our relationship with the UN in more political terms, even though the Commission has achieved the masterly feat of producing a document of nearly fifty pages that refers not even once to Parliament and the budgetary authority. I think that any redefinition will also necessitate dialogue between the Commission and Parliament. Now for a third comment, addressed to the Council. As we do in every Budget procedure, we have put a number of Budget lines in reserve, as the Council still refuses to provide the information agreed on in the November 2002 agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. This sometimes seems as if we are battering our heads against the Kremlin wall in the way we used to do. We are sure that we will overcome this obstacle and come to an agreement with the Council that will guarantee the public and Parliament greater transparency in future concerning what is going on in the common foreign and security policy.
costep_2010-04-21_7_2	Fellow Members, very important decisions have been taken in the European Union over the past few years aimed at protecting our environment. I would mention just the decision regarding biodiversity or the Water Framework Directive. The EU’s Water Framework Directive makes Member States responsible for protecting water quality and preventing pollution. Is this a worthy goal? Yes, it is. Is it our responsibility to do everything we can in order to reach this goal? Clearly it is. Are there any mining technologies that endanger our waters and our environment? Unfortunately, there are. Moreover, there is one extremely dangerous and, at the same time, obsolete technology in particular. Along with quite a few fellow Members, I would like this technology to be banned throughout the European Union. The cyanide disaster on the Tisza River ten years ago, as well as accidents that have occurred since then, also serve as reminders of this problem. Ladies and gentlemen, the present moment is one that is both fortunate and pressing. Fortunate, because according to the information received from the Commission, today only three countries still use this cyanide-based mining technology, and it is fortunate also because there are three other countries that have banned cyanide mining technology, thus setting an example for the other EU Member States. At the same time, it is also pressing since, on account of the rising price of gold, there are plans to open new mines throughout Europe using this dangerous and obsolete technology. This represents a serious threat to our environment. Ladies and gentlemen, if we are serious about the need to protect our waters, we cannot create cyanide-poisoned lakes alongside our rivers and lakes. Yet this is the result of this obsolete technology. If we are serious about safeguarding biodiversity, we cannot allow the use of technologies that can kill all forms of life in our rivers, from micro-organisms to crabs and fish. The time is ripe, distinguished fellow Members, to take action. Let us not wait for a new catastrophe to warn us of this. Finally, please allow me to thank all those fellow Members who are present and those who will participate in the debate, but who are unable to be here due to the eruption of the volcano, who have done a lot to help prepare this proposal for a decision, and thanks to whom we were able to present this House with a joint proposal for a text that is the fruit of compromise and that is supported not only by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) but also the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the European Conservatives and Reformists. I believe that, given the seriousness of the matter, this is absolutely justified. I would ask my fellow Members to continue their support through the final stage of the decision-making process.
costep_1999-12-01_6_3	I have a question for the Commissioner. In order to combat doping, there is one thing which we must do as a European Union. This is to fight against the over-commercialisation of sport which has led to a threefold increase in competitions. This is the reason for all the doping. While the Tour de France and the Giro d' Italia are as long as they are, and there are three matches per week for professional football teams, drugs will be used. While sport and the number of competitions are left unregulated, drugs will be used. If we do not do our duty by preparing a European directive on the protection of sportspeople, including professionals, we will not be tackling the root causes of doping.
costep_2000-07-06_6_46	Mr President, the Feira Council of 19 and 20 June 2000 showed a certain hypocrisy regarding a goodly number of subjects, and I will cite four of these. Regarding Austria, which was officially marginalised by the Council: the fourteen Heads of State and Government, having been foolish enough to impose unjustified sanctions, were then stupid enough not to be able to get out of the impasse they had got themselves into. This matter is particularly serious as it clearly shows that the powers of coercion given to the European Union can easily be used against national democratic expression. We should not forget this. On the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Heads of State and Government have mostly pretended not to know yet whether they wanted to include social rights and make the document binding in nature. There again, this is pure hypocrisy intended to beguile the opposition. In fact, the majority would like a comprehensive, binding document as it boils down to silencing the democratic expression of each individual nation, under the pretence of better safeguarding European values. On the pretext of unifying citizens' rights, the governments will succeed in taking from the nations the fundamental constitutional ability to define the rights which, for each country, are found at the heart of their own history and culture. With regard to enlargement, while hoping and praying for a rapid conclusion to negotiations, the Council has been hypocritical enough to erect new barriers before the candidate countries, such as, for example, the Charter itself, which could obviously complicate accession negotiations. Even on the subject of closer cooperation, which was added to the IGC agenda, the Council has hardly been sincere and has not said what it really meant by this. Earlier today, at the Constitutional Affairs Committee, I asked Joschka Fischer a question on this subject, but he wriggled out of replying. We will come back to that later.
costep_2005-10-24_1_25	Mr President, a revolution broke out in Hungary on 23 October 1956. The message of the revolution for posterity is threefold. The events of 1956 were profoundly democratic. The revolution involved the political participation of the entire society, it guaranteed equal human dignity for all, and proclaimed that suppressive dictatorial regimes cannot survive. On the other hand, it attempted to lay the foundations of a completely new political system. Thirdly, the revolution also had a message for Europe. It entered on the agenda of Europe the possibility of liquidating Communist tyranny. We, the Hungarian delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, declare the period up to the end of 2006 a Hungarian season, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the great Hungarian revolution.
costep_2006-10-24_9_15	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mr Romagnoli for his technical support, which has enabled me to explain my vote on the report by Mr Graça Moura establishing the Culture Programme. I voted in favour as I am hopeful about the future of this European Union, but I should like to stress that there is no such thing as culture when, in Italy, Mr Prodi’s Socialist-Communist government has decided, in accordance with Article 85(6) of the budget law, to deduct part of the pensions of the 500 000 Italian pensioners who have worked in Switzerland, thus ignoring the judgment of the Court of Cassation, which ruled that these very pensioners were entitled to draw four times their current pension. This is not fair, and I hope that 'culture' will also signify respect for pensioners' rights.
costep_2006-12-18_6_25	Mr President, I would like to thank the Finnish Presidency, above all for the way it dealt with the highly delicate strategic partnership with Russia. It appears to me that the Finnish presidency has done a great deal in dealing calmly but firmly with Russia, securing it as a strategic economic partner, whilst at the same time putting some pressure on the country to respect human rights and democracy at home. The presidency’s second achievement is the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union. And I would also like to congratulate it for ratifying the European Constitution. I believe that the Finnish Presidency is a good example of how to act on the European level to promote deeper integration, and how to achieve deeper integration whilst also opening the European Union to the outside world.
costep_2009-05-05_3_5	Madam President, as others have done, I would like to address my fellow Members and the Commissioner in order to thank them for the work they have all carried out, on which I believe we can congratulate ourselves today. I would also like to express my thanks for the unconditional support I have received as rapporteur of the GSM Directive, particularly to the shadow rapporteurs who have worked with me and to Commissioner Reding for the flexibility she has shown throughout the process of giving Parliament back the role we had been demanding: to take part in the strategic planning of the use of the radio spectrum. I must also, of course, thank the Czech Presidency for demonstrating its clear determination to resolve this directive along with the rest of the package before the end of the parliamentary term. As rapporteur of this GSM Directive, I believe that we have found the correct end solution, placing strategic planning for the spectrum at Community level within future multi-annual programmes of radio spectrum policy and linking it to the framework directive. It is the right decision because we are thus acknowledging that the spectrum, as a rare, public asset, needs legislative control as well as strategic planning in the development of new networks - the wireless and fibre optic networks - which are, as we have all agreed, the future, a future in which we must offer legal protection to operators so that they invest and we may recover the leadership that the European Union once showed. I wish to stress the fact that it is also very important that we have established the principle of technological neutrality for the network within that general framework because, given that it was an exception to that principle, we are doubly legitimising Parliament’s actions in a situation of this scale. In that context, I feel that this directive is a fine example to give spectrum management greater flexibility, as the reform of this telecommunications package intends. We should not forget - and I should like to highlight this, as some of my fellow Members have done - that in the European Union services related to the radio spectrum generate a turnover of around EUR 300 billion, that is, 1.2% of Community GDP. Therefore, optimising the management of this rare, public resource will no doubt bring important benefits, particularly in this time of economic crisis, and is sure to help us to emerge from the crisis. I think this is an investment opportunity for businesses to develop new services that can rekindle demand and also help to improve our citizens' public services. To be sure, an efficient spectrum policy in the European Union enables us to reap the greatest social and economic benefit from this resource, which we want to do as cost-effectively as possible; it also offers the best business opportunity for service providers. There is no doubt that it is of interest to us all to have more and better services for consumers, which is, ultimately, why we are legislating, and to have a better provision of public services for citizens. In other words, we want to be able to collaborate to achieve greater social and territorial inclusion of European citizens. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we can congratulate ourselves today for completing this work that is of tremendous importance to the telecommunications industry, a sector that, in 2008, continued growing at a rate of 1.3% in real terms, while overall GDP only made a real increase of 1%. I call on all of you to show your support for our work tomorrow so that we can finally implement this legislative framework.
costep_2004-05-05_1_89	The resounding rejection, notably by almost all French Members of the House, except for the Greens and the anti-federalists, of the amendment calling on the Prodi Commission - which is, in any case, at the end of its term in office - not to go back on the moratorium on GMOs established by the Council, is tantamount to Parliament giving its blessing to the decision that the Commission is set to take and which has, furthermore, already been announced by Commissioner Byrne, in favour of marketing BT-11 genetically modified maize and the varieties that will follow. Commissioner Byrne will probably make his announcement the day after the forthcoming European elections This is an extremely perverse process, in which the Commission overrides the States, with their tacit approval, as regards a question that is crucial for public health and for the environment in our countries. This legislative term is, therefore, coming to a close with a mean trick played on European citizens. It is essential that we reform this process if we are to rediscover a Europe that conforms to the wishes of the European public. Approval of the Minutes of that day's sitting - Written declarations: The sitting was closed at 12.59 p.m.
costep_2010-02-08_12_12	Mr President, we believe that the item on Madagascar is not particularly important today. We would therefore ask that that time slot be used to discuss the case of Mr Mumia Abu-Jamal, the Afro-American journalist who was found guilty of murdering a policeman in 1982, following a trial based on circumstantial evidence. Mumia Abu-Jamal has been sentenced to death and has been waiting on death row for 30 years. Up until now, no satisfactory explanation has been found for the events surrounding this murder and the evidence has never really been properly investigated. In any case, the death sentence is one of the clearest violations of human rights we know. Although, in this trial, the death sentence could have been commuted to lifelong imprisonment, the prosecution rejected this possibility at the end of January. The life of Mr Abu-Jamal is now more at risk than ever. We would like this matter to be debated in plenary so that we can decide what action to take in order to ensure that his death sentence is suspended and that Mumia Abu-Jamal is given the opportunity to prove his innocence in a fair trial.
costep_2009-11-23_17_9	At the end of voting time in the plenary session of 6 May 2009, the European Parliament approved a draft directive setting out the terms and conditions for electronic communication. However, the plenary also approved one amendment proposal which the Council regarded as being difficult to enforce. A conciliation procedure therefore ran up until 29 September, attempting to harmonise the views of the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament so as to ensure that the requirements contained in Article 138 could be transposed correctly into current European legislation. I would therefore like to applaud the efforts of the European Parliament’s negotiating team, as well as the businesslike and constructive approach taken by the representatives of the Council and the Commission, thanks to whom it was possible to reach agreement on the wording of the contentious provision in such a way that the aims and ideas contained in the original Article 138 were transposed in an acceptable way into the new telecommunications directive. I firmly believe that, following the conciliation procedure, the new telecommunications directive is ready to be applied in European public life.
costep_2010-10-18_14_4	Madam President, I joined Parliament 18 years ago now. Then, the European Parliament was a consultative parliament. It was a parliament that did not have any powers. In this process over the past 18 years, we have seen Parliament change from a consultative parliament to a fully colegislative one. Our good friend, Francisco Lucas Pires, who witnessed this process, said that it changed from a deliberative parliament to a legislative parliament. Therefore, the text that we are going to adopt on Wednesday is the culmination of negotiations between the Commission and Parliament on the framework agreement. I confess that when I tell my family that I am going to Strasbourg to take part in the debate on the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission, I have to give them quite a lengthy explanation. This is because, obviously, these things do not exist in national parliaments or at national level, so people do not understand why an agreement has to be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to implement what the treaties say. However, it does have to be done. It has to be done for a very basic reason, which Mr Rangel and Mr Šefčovič have already stated: because we want to be efficient. What the framework agreement is essentially seeking to do is to resolve all the practical obstacles that could arise in terms of legislation, parliamentary control and codes of conduct. I therefore believe that it is a good blend of European democracy. It is 'consensual' democracy rather than the 'conflictive' democracy that we have in our countries. In consensual democracy, the intelligent thing to do is to find solutions to any problems that could arise. Therefore, the framework agreement is an instrument for preventing future problems and making what the treaties say a reality. As we have a new treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon, it makes sense to implement it. I would like to congratulate Mr Rangel and the team that he led, and the European Commission, because I believe that they have reached a very reasonable agreement. When reading the content of the agreement, one cannot fail to be surprised at the voices being heard in some national parliaments questioning whether it poses a threat to the Council’s powers. For goodness' sake! The Council is indeed the other colegislator. We do want to legislate, and we are legislating a great deal and successfully with the Council of Ministers. We are colegislators on an equal footing. We do not need to gain any sort of small advantage. What we want is for this to be effective, and I believe that the agreement is going to help to achieve this. Allow me to say, Mr Šefčovič, that you took the bull by the horns - a very bullfighting-related expression in my country - when you said that the interpretation of Articles 6 and 7 of the resolution is Parliament’s interpretation in relation to international agreements and international conferences. I do not believe there is anything strange here. What we are talking about here is Parliament being informed and participating through the Commission and through negotiation, nothing more. What is the purpose? The purpose is for us to know what the Commission has done when we have to adopt it here. Therefore - and I will finish here Madam President - congratulations to both of you. I believe that this is a good omen: as they would say in Casablanca, 'the beginning of a beautiful friendship'.
costep_2008-01-23_6_26	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the presentation of this energy and climate change package. I fully agree with its priorities. In the Directive on the promotion of renewable energy sources, however, I think there is insufficient emphasis on the urgent need to promote technologies for converting biomass directly into gas. Such technologies have many applications, particularly owing to their overall efficiency as compared with conventional combustion. Another point I feel I must make concerns the directive on carbon dioxide storage. Financial aid seems to be directed first and foremost towards the coal and oil sectors. I cannot agree with this decision, given that there are other options for carbon dioxide capture in energy production processes, for example the use of microalgae in water. One last remark: if we really must use coal, then let us at least promote the technology for cleaner and more efficient conversion of coal into gas. Naturally I reserve the right to examine the final documents.
costep_2006-10-25_7_7	Mr President, I too am a Basque political representative. Basque and Spanish. I would like to state in this House that Basque society has always been against terrorism, not just now. I would like to state in this House that the terrorist group ETA is not an extremist organisation, it is a terrorist organisation, which for forty years has been murdering in violation of Spanish democracy. I would like to state in this House that there is no political conflict in Spain that is any different from that of any other democratic country in the European Union. These are the political conflicts inherent in democracy. What exists in Spain, in Euskadi, is a terrorist organisation, called ETA, which has been murdering in violation of democracy for forty years. Mr President, I have not voted for any of the Resolutions in a political gesture opposed to a debate entitled 'on the peace process in Spain', because I am fifty-four, Mr President, I have never lived through war, I have lived the whole of my life in Euskadi and in Euskadi we do not lack peace, we lack freedom. The challenge is therefore freedom, and to talk about a peace process may encourage certain people to have the nerve to claim that terrorism is a product of a political conflict, and there is no such political conflict in our country.
costep_2007-12-10_22_10	Mr President, sometimes it is a shame that there is no open debate, then I could reply to Mr Van Orden, but I shall not do so. The worldwide campaign against landmines could be seen as a great success. Thousands of square kilometres of land are now free of landmines thanks to the work of people taking great risks in Bosnia, Angola and many other countries. However, 10 years after the Ottawa Convention, there is still no reason to be cheerful. Although 156 countries have signed the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, and there has been a decrease - a drastic decrease - in trade, there is still investment in the production of landmines, including by financial institutions in Europe. Dutch and other banks and pension funds are guilty of this. It is good to point out to these institutions the consequences of their investment in landmines. After all, since 1975, landmines have been responsible for one million deaths. They claim tens of thousands of lives each year. During this debate they will claim at least three lives, 70 per day. Landmines have made 200 000 square kilometres of land inaccessible, and there are still 250 million of them in circulation. The governments of Burma and Russia still lay mines, and that, Mr Van Orden, is rather different from 'terrorist clubs', but then again the Russian Government There are still 13 countries in the world that either produce them or reserve the right to do so again in future. In the US, companies such as Alliant Techsystems and Textron continue to produce mines undisturbed, with orders from the US Government. Mr President, Commissioner Kuneva, investment in landmines is banned in Belgium, but companies are active in the rest of Europe; one Member referred to Rheinmetall and Thales. This activity has to stop, and that is exactly what our resolution is calling for, or rather is calling for again, as the European Parliament made the same demand back in July 2005. The EU Member States must agree together that there should be not one European company or financial institution still investing in companies that develop and produce landmines in the future. The same must happen in the case of cluster bombs and anti-vehicle mines, which explode as soon as someone comes into the vicinity. The arms industry is not influenced by ethical arguments. The threat of an investment ban has the potential to help. Let the EU take this initiative and make an exception to the rule that politics does not interfere in the investment policy of trade and industry. In respect of matters that are banned under international treaties, political intervention is a moral and political obligation - and this should be incorporated into European and national legislation, in the interests of a world without landmines and without anti-vehicle mines, as Mrs Beer quite rightly said. We should like to hear your opinion on this, Commissioner Kuneva. The European Commission needs to show initiative in this field at long last. Finally, it needs to do more in the way of mine-clearance effort. We have the money, we have the know-how, but the European effort is lagging behind.
costep_2001-11-15_5_62	I have just voted against the Schörling Report. The Group of the European People’s Party/European Democrats, to which I belong, did not manage to secure a majority in favour of its constructive amendments. What has now been adopted has clearly been influenced too much by ideology. Of course this is about environmental safety, but it is also about competitive and innovative jobs in the chemical industry. Over the last few weeks I have been investigating the consequences of the Schörling Report by talking to those whom it will affect. I have visited production plants and had discussions with management, workers and unions. None of those parties is calling into question the aim of the Commission’s White Paper, which is to secure the sustainability of the chemical industry. From an ecological point of view, we obviously need the greatest possible protection of the environment and consumers. From an economic point of view, we need uniform basic conditions so as to ensure that there is fair competition for SMEs, users and processors. From a social point of view this is about having a high level of health protection and high standards of industrial safety. At least we were able to prevent the registration requirement for substances with a production volume of one tonne per year from being introduced. As it is, the current classification of substances above 10 tonnes per year and the reporting requirement before they are put on the market is only being managed by the authorities with great difficulty. The European People’s Party Group did succeed in one respect: there was no majority in favour of double testing all chemicals. This does not increase safety and is costly in terms of time and money; incidentally it is completely unnecessary because the authorities already examine these data. I do not consider it acceptable to find substitutes for dangerous substances and methods which should otherwise be banned. You cannot define a substance as 'dangerous' on the basis of its properties, but only on the basis of its uses. Take a knife: it is extremely useful at home and in everyday life, but it becomes dangerous if it is used as a weapon for anything from attacking people to hijacking aircraft. It is also regrettable that it has been agreed that confidential data should be made public: if production volumes, procedures or special compositions, which account for a market advantage, all have to be declared, then we may as well do away with competition right now. This is the lifeblood of our companies. Any competitor can easily imitate ingenious systems. We need to establish once and for all which data are subject to property rights and which are not. Before the second reading in Parliament, I hope that the three committees working on this will put their heads together and come up with a more balanced proposal.
costep_2001-05-31_1_18	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, achieving genuine equality for women and men is one of the most important social and political tasks. Women still suffer discrimination in the labour market. Women still earn less than men. Women are under-represented in senior management. Throughout Europe, unemployment is higher among women than men. Mrs Hautala’s report is an important contribution to equal opportunities. However, I believe that the directive should take more aspects of women’s working lives into account. The proposed reform does not go far enough. For example, it fails to provide regulations on equal employment conditions for women. Women must have equal pay for work of equal value! We need targeted re-integration measures after career breaks. I work actively to ensure that women and men have equal opportunities in every area of society. I urge the Council and the Commission to adopt measures to achieve these objectives.
costep_1998-06-18_4_64	Madam President, anyone familiar with Guinea-Bissau in the past is aware of the reasons for the present crisis. A few decades ago the people still lived relatively well. Perhaps they were not rich, there was no great development, but the Portuguese really achieved something to be proud of there. The country then collapsed through corruption and international intervention. I think you just have to admit that environmental protection, for instance, is today nothing short of terrible. When I was there, a long time ago now, people could really live on islands like Bijagós. They had enough to eat, whereas now everything has been destroyed by pollution. That is the price that has been paid for government without conscience - the present one has been much better, but up to now it has had to settle the bill. We should be doing everything we can to help the extremely likeable people of Guinea-Bissau to get back on the right track.
costep_2010-03-25_3_6	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me firstly congratulate and thank the rapporteur, Mr Giegold, who has proposed a work of high quality and has shown himself ready to listen to the rapporteurs from other groups. This report, the European Parliament’s response to the European Commission annual statement on the euro area and public finances, is rich in analyses and proposals. Of course, it is, to a great extent, marked by the big event of 2009, the economic and financial crisis, which is without any doubt the most serious crisis the European Union has faced since it was created. I have learnt two main lessons from this crisis. On the one hand, the Economic and Monetary Union has shown how useful it is. The euro, a stable common currency, has played the part of a real monetary shield. Belonging to the euro area has enabled more than one country to avoid a devaluation of their national currencies, which would have further exacerbated the consequences of the crisis. The euro area has therefore become more attractive, as the case of Iceland shows. Moreover, the active and flexible monetary policy conducted by the ECB, increasing its injections of liquid funds into lending establishments, has played a significant role in keeping European banks afloat. The first lesson then is that while we often say that Europe was built on crises, this one has shown that economic Europe is both effective and necessary at the same time. From this I draw the second lesson, which is that we should strengthen European economic governance. Today, the only genuine European economic policy is monetary policy. There is limited coordination of budget policies. However, the euro area, which - as mentioned again by this report - is intended to integrate all the Member States of the European Union, must establish effective governance in every aspect of economic policy. It must begin with macro-economic as well as financial monitoring, something we are busy working on in the European Parliament. It must be carried forward within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact as a real instrument of fiscal coordination. At this time of crisis, the considerable drop in revenue, the tax incentive measures taken within the framework of the recovery plan and the operation of economic stabilisers have led to a deterioration of the budget balances of the Member States. Reducing public debt remains a fundamental commitment, as it concerns our children’s future. Let us be austere, but let us also be inventive. Let us think about a new European fiscal policy, let us think about eurobonds, and let us be bold in European economic governance.
costep_2006-11-15_21_11	I welcome this important report and I would also like to express my thanks to Mrs Edit Bauer for her work. I am glad that some of my amendments have been adopted in the Subcommittee on Human Rights, and I trust that they too have contributed to the quality of this report. Trafficking in human beings is one of the most sophisticated, best organised and most profitable forms of criminal activity. This is a problem not only for the developing world, but also for the European Union. In my amendments I focused on the fact that most of the victims of sexual abuse and trafficking in human beings are minors, who constitute the most vulnerable section of the population. For instance, the consent of a child to prostitution may not be viewed in the same way as the consent of an adult who is aware of the consequences of his or her conduct. Many international agreements and treaties have been signed on this issue. However, many states have not even ratified these instruments and those that have ratified them fail to enforce them, which results in these documents becoming irrelevant. Although at international conferences attended by various states we all agree that we really must implement these documents to which we all subscribe, such efforts frequently cease on the last day of the conference and the status quo remains unchanged. In addition to focusing on the customer-victim relationship, it is necessary to pay attention to employers, especially in countries where visa requirements are not applied. Cooperation must exist between the three elements, that is, the country of origin, the transit countries and the destination countries. It is necessary to monitor the operation and trustworthiness of employment agencies, including those that are thought to recruit only seasonal workers. Companies that employ cheap labour obtained through human trafficking must be punished extremely heavily. Inspections at facilities providing sexual services will not suffice. It would be desirable also to have administrative inspections in addition to the penalties set out under criminal law. The funding available to the non-governmental organisations that deal with political rights is many times greater than that available to NGOs addressing human trafficking or women’s rights. Sadly, this appears to reflect how countries have set their priorities.
costep_2001-10-25_5_10	Mr President, Commissioner, we did not need the Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy to tell us about the serious problems facing fisheries in Europe. The Green Paper has merely made clear once again how serious they are. Our Committee is earnestly discussing the various approaches to solving the problems. We know we shall not be able to make all the difficulties simply disappear by waving a magic wand. If somebody really wants to pull the wool over our eyes about it, we must call it what it is, namely eyewash. The common fisheries policy as it has existed up until now has not succeeded in preventing the crises affecting a number of fish stocks or in reducing overcapacities in fleets. Whether we will all survive economically depends on the Union’s future ability to shape a fisheries policy in the new century. The Commission is now proposing extending the current multi-annual guidance programme for one year. In the light of the ongoing debate on reform, I think we also need such measures for the sake of continuity. We cannot of course solve the problems in this short space of time, but perhaps we can alleviate them a little. The crucial thing is that the programme should be properly carried out. We need data, but some Member States fail to provide that data or their data is incomplete. We therefore need a system of penalties to ensure the data is supplied at all, and we need comparable criteria and categories. Every shipowner wants to increase efficiency. But we must not shift the premises. We want better safety at sea. That is a central part of the European Parliament’s demands. But at the same time we should be careful to avoid negative effects on safety, even dressed up as increased efficiency. The proposed change to structural measures also misses the target at the present time. Making the achievement of objectives in all segments of the fleet a precondition for public subsidies is counterproductive because it penalises everyone for the failings of a few. Our policy will only find acceptance among fishermen if the conditions are fair.
costep_2011-04-06_12_38	Mr President, I want to begin by expressing my complete sympathy for the Japanese people. I believe that it is important now for us to give them every support we can. The Fukushima accident has shown us that some existing nuclear power plants are not safe. This is why we must attach greater importance to nuclear safety. I think that it is vital to carry out safety tests on the nuclear power plants immediately. On the other hand, however, we must avoid the pitfall of making emotional and unfounded decisions about whether to keep or abandon nuclear energy. The decision about the composition of the energy mix must remain under Member States' jurisdiction, while the European Union’s role must be to ensure that the highest safety standards are applied. However, any measure taken at European or national level with regard to the energy mix and regulating nuclear energy must be based on a high level of scientific objectivity.
costep_2011-03-09_11_191	EU integration is the main driving force behind Montenegro’s progress. This country has achieved a lot in the last 12 months, successfully implementing structural and economic reforms, and effectively combating corruption and organised crime. Ethnic minorities live together peacefully in Montenegro and the country successfully promotes good neighbourhood relations. The EU and Montenegro therefore signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. I voted in favour of this resolution, because it rightly indicates further steps to reform Montenegro. It is necessary to make progress in the establishment of the rule of law, to continue to implement administrative reforms, improve the capacities of civil servants, amend electoral law, and strengthen civil society and the independent media. It is important for the country to maintain the momentum and to continue the work it has begun.
costep_1999-02-08_4_5	Mr President, I would like to add my voice to Mrs García Arias'. I am sure that not only will the Spanish Socialists regret Mrs Díez de Rivera’s departure, but that she will be sorely missed by all Members of this House, whatever their nationality. We all pay tribute to our fellow Member’s work. We are aware that she resigned for health reasons, and hope she will recover and be able to return to the House. She will be constantly in our thoughts. We recognise the significance of her work and pay tribute to her unfailingly friendly and approachable manner in her dealings with all Members, regardless of their political affiliation.
costep_2010-10-20_7_151	Parliament has just voted at first reading for extending maternity leave to a minimum of 20 weeks all over Europe, paid at full salary, except for high earners, and the possibility for fathers to take at least two weeks' leave following the birth of a child. This is a victory for the proponents of a social Europe and a step towards more equality between men and women in Europe. A section of the right used the future cost of these measures as an excuse to reject this progress. Yet helping parents to reconcile family and work life will make it easier for parents to go back to work, will boost European birth rates and will safeguard the health of mothers and babies. The left of Parliament, with Portuguese Socialist rapporteur Mrs Estrela, held strong, the European right was divided and the move towards progress won the day. The battle must now be won at the Council, where several governments are threatening to block this directive. Members of national parliaments should take this up and intervene with their government so that governments do not undo what the European Parliament is proposing for a Europe that protects its citizens' rights.
costep_2010-10-07_5_15	Mr President, I should like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to an aspect of this resolution, which is of central and not secondary importance to me, and which can give the policies of regional cohesion their full meaning. The challenge is to identify the best instrument to enable us to measure the state of development of the European regions as accurately as possible and to have at our disposal the best decision support instrument, especially for deciding on eligibility for European funds. It is about having a political compass to guide us towards this 'targeted approach to territorial development', to quote the proposed resolution, towards this integrated approach. What is this guide on which to base our regional cohesion policies? Today, we have just a single indicator, gross domestic product, which is an excellent indicator and an excellent instrument for measuring economic growth and the production of wealth. However, regional development issues are not confined to increasing gross domestic product. People’s well-being cannot simply be expressed as an index or a curve. If it could, we would be in danger of ending up with an indicator that gives nothing more than a distorted, partial and therefore one-sided view. To pursue regional cohesion policies that are relevant to the objective of the sustainable development of the regions - which, I would point out, is our shared objective - the gross domestic product index must be supplemented by other instruments of measurement, particularly in the social and environmental spheres. It must be possible to assess the level of unemployment, insecure employment, education, health, environmental quality, air and water quality, protection of resources, access to basic services, etc. In conclusion, therefore, we need to do our utmost to establish, alongside gross domestic product, a battery of social and environmental indicators to facilitate regional cohesion policies whose aim is sustainable development based on the three pillars of economic factors, social factors and the environment.
costep_2010-03-09_7_34	The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that. This support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of relocations that occur in a globalised context. An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in various countries, particularly China and India, often to the detriment of countries that respect workers' rights. The EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of the relocation of companies, and it is fundamental in helping them have access to new employment in the future. The EGF has already been used in the past by other EU countries, particularly Portugal and Spain, so we should now grant this aid to Lithuania.
costep_1998-09-17_8_43	Thank you, Madam President. Despite certain positive elements, my group has not been able to vote for your report, Mrs Marinucci. Our first amendment states, on behalf of freedom of choice, that women must be able to choose between immediately finding a job or delaying entering the labour market in order to devote a number of years to having children and bringing them up. This amendment was, in fact, rejected. The report does contain certain positive points, particularly where you recognise that we need to discuss whether family dependant care should be given recognition in national accounts. However, in spite of such points, I cannot support the general philosophy of your text, which represents a collectivist socialist option for the care of children. Mrs Marinucci, children do not only need to be looked after; they are not only a problem for the organisation of their parents' professional life. They also need to be educated, more than they ever did before, and there are men and women who wish to educate them. I met many young women during the run-up to the Beijing Conference. You say that you are sorry that women in Europe are forced to give up their careers. That is all very well, but I would also point out that, at the moment, many young women in Europe are saying that they regret having to give up having more children because there is no genuine family policy worthy of the name in Europe. This has negative repercussions on demography, which is currently a structural cause of Europe’s unemployment. But that is currently a taboo subject in Europe’s institutions.
costep_2008-06-04_21_25	Dear colleagues, I would like to welcome the shares program initiated by the Council of Europe, which aims to eliminate all forms of violence among children and I am convinced that in 2009 physical punishment will be forbidden all over the world. Yet, I would like to underline the need for a common campaign on a European level, by means of which children become aware of the fact that violence towards them is against the law and that they must confess any ill treatment they are subjected to. In some EU Member States, parents regard physical punishment as a normal method of education and children assume this as being normal. The future of the European Union depends on the way children’s rights are observed, and during their education we must have in mind an approach that forbids any form of violence.
costep_2000-01-18_10_20	Mr President, I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report. I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch, now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so. Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this. I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement, also with its amendments. I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic. I think that this is also the case here, but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments. I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective. Mr President, one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is, to my mind, the rapporteur’s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration. A very important proposal indeed. I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan, because she wants to scrap it altogether. I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale. On the one hand, we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well, as a result of which, in fact, the entire content of this report vanishes. I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock, but I happen to know Mr Kinnock. He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary. In my opinion, such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary. Finally, the issue of officials. Actually, I do not entirely share Mr Haarder’s view. I do agree that the section on officials has, in fact, been completed totally inadequately. First of all, the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised. Secondly, all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted, and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement. For example, we are currently looking into TAOs. This is a key point but, at the same time, we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission. These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other, and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table.
costep_2001-02-14_12_8	Mr President, the radical members of the Bonino List will vote against the proposal for a Council initiative and therefore, while voting in favour of some of amendments improving the rapporteur’s proposals, we will also vote against the report as a whole. The fundamental reason for this is one that affects these and all initiatives dealing with the framework of criminal legislation in the Union. As a European federalist, and therefore not a Eurosceptic, I consider it monstrous that criminal legislation should be adopted and implemented without any approval by a democratically and legitimately elected Parliament with the legitimacy to grant it. Here, as elsewhere, I find the road the European Union is taking monstrous. Criminal law cannot be removed from parliamentary debate. Because of the very delicacy of the matter, it cannot be abstracted from more general considerations relating to society, risks, weights and counterweights, fundamental causes, and economic and social causes. The only line on which European integration policy is advancing rapidly is that of repression, because that is easy. Decisions are prepared by groups of civil servants from the Ministries of Justice and Home Affairs, whose only concern is the efficiency of the repression mechanisms, without any consideration - it is not their fault, that is their craft, their professional approach - or concern for issues arising from society, the economy, work, international policy or development. We are travelling very fast down the line of repression while, on the other lines, such as guaranteeing the right of asylum and the right to a defence, the European Parliament, the European Union, the European Commission and the Council are incapable of making progress. So that is the main reason why we cannot accept the Council’s proposals. We cannot accept a report which does not reject them out of hand because, even on this matter, the European Parliament - as usual - is just being consulted and does not have any real powers. As to the merit of the argument - as Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and Mrs Frahm have said - it is an illusion to imagine that strengthening the ban on immigration produces anything other than a strengthening of illegal immigration and the forces of illegality overwhelming us. Our frontiers are being overwhelmed by the illegality produced by our prohibitionist laws. That is the reality. We should not delude ourselves that we can solve the problem by tinkering with the penalties for carriers of illegal immigrants without democratic consultation. It is possible - although I hope this does not happen - that we will only succeed in making things worse. At the same time, the fundamental economic causes are not being addressed. Commissioner Lamy put a brave proposal to the European Commission for unilateral liberalisation of imports from the poorest countries. That is a means of attacking the fundamental causes, not just doling out charity, alms and assistance but opening our markets to their agricultural products and basic manufacturers. 'Everything but arms' the proposal was called. It was sunk by the lobbies in the European Union and, consequently, pressure from migrations is growing ever stronger. So the Lamy proposal gets sunk and, at the same time, we delude ourselves that we can solve the problem by a few months' increase in the penalties meted out to those who ply a trade we have presented them with as a gift, for profits we, with our laws, make possible. We cannot delude ourselves - I say this to Mr Ceyhun and Members on the left - that partial improvement - we are in favour of certain amendments - of this repressive framework can change the situation. Only as a lesser evil do we support the distinction between immigration for economic profit and immigration for humanitarian purposes, but we do not think it can solve the problem, as you on the left point out yourselves, when you assert that economic causes are ultimately responsible for immigration. How can you sustain the argument that economic causes are the fundamental causes and, at the same time, take such a strong stand against the entrepreneurs and profiteers running illegal immigration? This prohibitionist attitude is not confined to immigration alone, but also to the labour market and the new forms of employment - part-time work, temporary work, short-term contracts, seasonal contracts - and it is an attitude that the left, and the unions too, are largely responsible for in Europe. Let us not try to salve our consciences by attacking the entrepreneurs and those who exploit labour for, in the eyes of the exploited, the people condemned to die in their own country of hunger and a total lack of the means to survive, the European entrepreneur-exploiter may well be the only hope of advancement and salvation for them and their families. So I conclude, Mr President, by confirming the vote of the Bonino List radical Members against the motion.
costep_2006-11-14_15_16	Mr President, reading the legislative programme and listening to the presentation of the Commission’s work for 2007, we can but conclude that we are in for more of the same; more of the same neoliberalism, which is undermining social and labour rights, which is making work more unstable, which is returning to old methods of exploitation, which is promoting the liberalisation of services, including public services, leaving no one in any doubt as to the intentions behind what is referred to as the Lisbon Strategy. In the name of flexibility, the completion of the internal market and globalisation, employment contracts are being trampled underfoot, and there is a danger of more multinational company relocations, as in the case of GM Opel in Azambuja, Johnson Controls in Nelas and Portalegre, and Lear in Valongo, to name but a few of the most serious cases currently threatening thousands of workers in Portugal, where unemployment is already very high following redundancies in the textile, clothing and footwear industries. It is these unemployed workers who are now at the mercy of temporary employment agencies and other unscrupulous bosses, as in the recent cases we have heard about in the media of hungry and penniless Portuguese workers in the south of the Netherlands. Is this the social responsibility of business in action? At the same time, in the name of the single currency and price stability, the European Central Bank regularly raises interest rates and governments use the Stability and Growth Pact to undermine manufacturing, hinder social development, undermine micro and small enterprises and create a culture that is conducive to the shameful exploitation of emigrant and immigrant workers and their families. We therefore stress the need for a sea change away from these neoliberal policies. The time has come to prioritise social development and welfare policies and I should like to call for solidarity in the case of hungry, exploited Portuguese workers such as those in the south of the Netherlands whose cases have just come to light.
costep_1998-05-02_4_71	Madam President, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I do not intend to cast doubt on the intentions of all our colleagues today, but despite the communist experience, I see sadly that Marxism is triumphant in Europe. I do not believe or accept that monetary and economic infrastructures are determining factors in what Marx used to call political or other superstructures. In addition, we have seen today what is really a stopgap measure rather than a real study of remedies for the catastrophic situation which affects all spheres of activity and which is present in each of our different countries in Europe. For what good is monetary stability when social stability does not exist, when we are faced with a real disintegration of our societies? Moreover, in going back to the great intellectual and humanist heritage of Europe, I am appealing for an in-depth review of economic science, which is not a science like any other, but which is a human science. Today, we have witnessed a defeat of thought, a defeat of economic thought and a defeat of political thought.
costep_2010-03-10_12_30	Madam President, for us, it is relatively easy to talk, when human rights violations take place elsewhere and people are also dying for their beliefs. It is important to make this point. Mr Zapata really has lost his life as a result of his hunger strike, and there are also other prisoners who have now been prompted to go on hunger strike. We need, therefore, to give specific thought to how we can move forwards in a targeted way. Some have said that we absolutely should not talk to Cuba because the regime there is unacceptable to us. Others - and I do not think this position is a good one at all, Mr Ferreira - have expressed the opinion that there is hypocrisy here and that the people of Cuba should be allowed the freedom to make their own political decisions. I believe that the freedom to make political decisions really stops where human rights are violated and people die. In those circumstances we, as the European Parliament, must do something. Against that backdrop, it is absolutely right for the specific proposals that have been laid on the table - not least including a few new suggestions from Mr Gahler - to be discussed in detail and for us to consider what we can do to intervene against human rights violations all over the world and to help the people of the world.
costep_2001-02-14_5_5	Mr President, Commissioner, President of the EIB, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lipietz, for his excellent report. The European Investment Bank is a non-profit-making body because that is what the Member States' governments decided, since its mission was not to obtain economic benefits but rather to contribute to the balanced development of the European Community through granting medium and long-term credits and guarantees for investment projects in the poorest regions, thus fostering economic and social cohesion. But if we examine what the prime orientation for EIB funding is, where have the loans granted in 1999 ended up? We see that most have been used to cofinance investments in the four richest Member States (Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy), which received over 60% of the EIB resources supplementing the Community structural funds, while the so-called cohesion countries, that is, the poorest and most needy ones (Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland) got only 26%. Even if I am told that this inequality occurs on account of the populations of these Member States, I believe we have to think about this aspect, since balanced development will not be achieved through proportionality but through solidarity. This will become even more necessary as we proceed with enlargement to include new Member States. Do not let it be said, either, that what is happening is that the less well-off countries do not submit projects to be funded; what is needed is a better policy of information, transparency, aid and monitoring. To that end, it could well begin by facilitating communication with possible applicants, providing for the use of all the languages of the European Union, including regional and minority languages, so that everybody can have access to the European Investment Bank.
costep_2003-05-14_3_17	Mr President, we all knew that there was going to be a humanitarian disaster and that it was going to affect women and children especially, who make up the majority of the Iraqi population. We MEPs who were in Baghdad and Basra witnessed this in particular. The inspectors there told us - as did Mr Blix in the United Nations - that there were no weapons of mass destruction. I do not know what we are surprised about. But we were not aware of the immense irresponsibility of the occupiers. Chaos and the law of the jungle reign in Iraq and the citizens lack protection. And I would draw attention to the fact that the majority of the future occupiers are members of the European Union: the United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, the Spanish State, while the European Union is absent. In this regard, Mr President, it seems to me ludicrous that Mr Poettering is still saying that we cannot create a European Union in opposition to the United States. Quite the contrary: the United States - the extreme right governing there - is working against the European Union as a body with a presence in the world. We are witnessing an unacceptable situation which this Parliament must condemn on behalf of the citizens of Europe who demonstrated against it. Mr President, we must call for the full restoration of United Nations law and we must point out once again that the 'oil for food' programme and the inspections are the sole responsibility of the United Nations. Otherwise, the established law will be broken, even with resolutions which the occupiers originally approved. In any event, I would like to say in particular today that I reject the position of the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Aznar, who has become a servant of the extreme right currently governing the United States. He wants to turn the Spanish State into a new Puerto Rico. Particularly in view of the fact that this goes against the views of the majority of the Spanish people. Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, all possible humanitarian assistance must be provided, of course; but above all, if this assistance is to be effective, the political presence of the European Union and the United Nations is needed.
costep_1997-10-23_3_65	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the previous speakers have already referred to the enormity of the catastrophe unleashed by the forest fires currently raging in south-east, especially Indonesia. Areas greater than any of the largest Member States of the Union are on fire. The joint motion for a resolution, drawn up by six political groups, refers to the devastating effects of the fires on the health and small-scale economies of millions of people in the areas affected, and I wish to endorse those statements. However, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to underline as forcefully as possible the concern caused by the growing number of natural disasters of this kind and by the absence of measures to rectify certain of the developed world’s industrial activities, which threaten the environment and cause climate change, in the face of the lack of action on the part of those who are obliged to adopt more effective preventive measures. The statement to the National Geographic Society made just a few hours ago by President Clinton, announcing his proposals concerning the reduction of CO2 emissions, is quite simply inadequate. It is inadequate in terms of both the final objectives and the deadlines announced. We are on the eve of the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Kyoto. We are obliged to make an effort to ensure that the Kyoto Conference is not a failure, as has been the case with a number of previous conferences of this kind in the latter part of the century. We cannot simply wait for disasters like that occurring in Indonesia to happen, and then provide funds and send experts to put out the fire, whilst simultaneously remaining paralysed in our efforts to adopt measures to prevent global warming, which is the origin and cause of a great many disasters.
costep_2010-10-07_13_294	The European Parliament has voted for a resolution on the future of the European Social Fund (ESF). At a time when the ESF is being questioned, in particular, by the President of the Commission, who wishes to integrate it into a much larger fund with diluted objectives, the European Parliament’s support of the ESF is significant. The resolution supports the role of the ESF in EU regional and social policy and calls for the procedures for allocating funds to be simplified. Indeed, these highly restrictive procedures do not facilitate the distribution of funds in a way that is really suited to the needs of populations, and they also result in non-consumption of appropriations, particularly in France, which is a scandal in itself. I regret, however, that the resolution revives, among other things, the dogma of 'updating education systems' and calls for these to be adapted solely to the needs of companies in order to improve access to the labour market.
costep_2002-07-04_4_130	'When my chickens continued to lay eggs, I was formally in breach of the law?, according to a white farmer in Zimbabwe. This neatly, and tragicomically, sums up the criminal madness of President Mugabe’s land appropriations policy. Criminal madness indeed, for how else can a government policy be described when it simply comes down to pure theft on a massive scale, with probably a huge famine around the corner? Mugabe’s regime prohibits thousands of white farmers from continuing to work. In this way, it also leaves hundreds of thousands of black land workers and their families with no means of support. And this with the winter harvest on the fields ? Imagine too the improbable situation which white cattle farmers are facing thanks to Mugabe. Cows simply need to be milked. To the power-mad President and his entourage, the country’s white farmers and the opposition are all one and the same, and they are dealt with mercilessly, even if the country is heading for a humanitarian disaster. By the way, President Mugabe had the audacity to show up in all his glory at last month’s World Food Summit in Rome. At the same time, a Zimbabwean economic expert lamented that 'not one government in Africa has condemned this theft of private property?, rightly following that up by asking what trust the outside world can place in the New Partnership for African Development. This joint motion for a resolution faces all African leaders with the same pressing question. It thus calls for credible African action against Mugabe’s reign of terror. I hope and expect that the Council, the Commission and the Member States will actually endorse this appeal.
costep_2010-02-24_22_24	I congratulate the European Commission on having submitted to the Council the amended regulation on investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Union. The report enriches the contents in a meaningful and up-to-date way, and does so for two reasons. The first reason is to provide transparent information on the security and confidentiality of the sensitive data that the Commission will have to receive periodically in order to manage energy policy effectively. The report is in line with the Treaty of Lisbon, in which particular attention is paid to energy policy by means of the strengthening and coordinating of its methods and of the investments required for the sector. The Copenhagen Summit’s failure to satisfy the world’s political leaders means that the policies to be pursued require a change of strategy. The European Parliament is paying particular attention to the problem with the aim of overseeing energy investments in the construction, transport and storage of associated energy products, so as to satisfy the production and distribution industries and hence safeguard consumers' health. The second reason is that, since the EU has a shortage of energy products and internal demand - like imports - is growing every day, EU energy policy must focus on diversification, security of supply and energy efficiency.
costep_2003-09-24_3_108	The European Parliament took an important step towards greening European Union energy taxation today, by giving the green light to the directive restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity. I hope the Council’s reaction will now be equally constructive, and that there will not be a repeat of the veto which precluded any revision of this very same piece of legislation in 1997. One of the most important objectives of any sustainable development policy is to internalise environmental externalities into the economy. In other words, the price of goods must reflect their real environmental cost. The message sent by the price is essential in order to induce both producers and consumers to realign their choices towards sustainability. That situation is, unfortunately, still a long way off, which is why buying green is still a luxury and selling green is not yet sufficiently profitable. I welcome the rapporteur’s advocacy of more ambitious and binding rules, and in particular of lowering taxes on goods produced using renewable energy sources while raising taxes on fossil fuels for use in transport.
costep_2010-03-09_7_129	In 1997, the Commission published the work of the first Internal Market Scoreboard. which focused on the implementation of the rules of the internal market by the Member States, given that substantial delays were preventing members of the public and businesses from making the most of the internal market. Through the assessment and publication of developments regarding implementation, the Evaluation Panel has contributed to a reduction in the level of non-implementation of directives by the Member States. I voted in favour of the present report as I consider it imperative that the Member States incorporate internal market legislation into their national legislation in a timely way, because the internal market can only operate properly if EU regulations relating to its operation are correctly implemented and applied, and if checks on compliance are made.
costep_2005-11-30_1_105	October 27-28 marked the renewal of negotiations on the Trans-Dniester region, which are now being carried out under the ‘five plus two’ principle: Russia, Ukraine, the OSCE, Moldova and the Trans-Dniester region, the five previous participants in the negotiations, were joined by the USA and the European Union, both taking part as observers. Moldova has more than once declared its intentions for European integration, but the most acute obstacle the country is facing is the Trans-Dniester issue. Admittedly, one cannot expect immediate important results right at the beginning of the renewed negotiations. However, I would like to point out that the biggest concern lies in the fact that the USA and the European Union have signed a document treating the two parts of Moldova as equal parties to the conflict, with Russia being an intermediary. I am convinced that the EU has failed to take a well-considered position in this particular case. Its position is flawed because the Trans-Dniester issue amounts to a conflict between Russia and Moldova, i.e. Russia should not be considered as an intermediary.
costep_2008-03-26_6_42	Mr President, your excellent statement and the present debate show that the European Parliament does not want to remain silent, that it does not want to collude with a dictatorship’s oppression of a minority. We know that it is very difficult to exert pressure on a country like China that carries great weight in global politics, and it is better to persuade them to negotiate with the Dalai Lama on Tibet’s situation. The Chinese had the wisdom to find a solution in the case of Hong Kong and Macao based on the principle of 'one country, two systems'. This might be one way of resolving the present situation too: for Tibet to be part of China, but having very wide-ranging autonomy under the leadership of the Dalai Lama, because the current level of autonomy falls short of what the Tibetan people want. Mr Geremek has provided a framework for this, and I would like to put forward an idea: let us try to persuade the Chinese that there is indeed a feasible solution that would maintain China’s territorial integrity while at the same time providing the Tibetan people with the autonomy they deserve. Mr President, I am proud of you as the President of this Parliament.
costep_2005-12-01_1_98	Without wishing to become embroiled in a debate on tax harmonisation and the common VAT arrangements, the main purpose of this resolution is to extend for a further year - until the end of 2006 - the trial period for those Member States that chose to do so to apply a reduced rate of VAT to certain labour-intensive services. We feel that, as this is a one-off measure, it can help to promote job creation and to reduce the parallel economy. It is too early at this stage to assess the socio-economic impact of this measure, which will also lead to greater flexibility in terms of indirect taxation. It should be borne in mind that, were this measure to end suddenly, prices could rise. These arrangements should apply to all current Member States, as new Member States should not be subject to discrimination, which would be unacceptable. The sitting was closed at 11.50 a.m.
costep_2011-01-19_10_46	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall confine myself to asking the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, to place a specific request on the agenda of our relations with Egypt: we call on the Egyptian authorities to remove information on religion from official documents, identity cards, passports and all documents needed to obtain work. Christians are discriminated against in Egypt since the word 'Christian' is included on their documents. Islamic terrorism has now become legitimate in a situation in which there is institutionalised discrimination against Christians. This is a specific request which, if implemented, would free Christians from one form of institutionalised discrimination.
costep_2011-04-04_17_45	We are all aware of violence against women, and we debate it, but when it comes to eliminating or doing away with it, the results are poor. Violence affects women at various times of life, from childhood to adulthood. It happens in school, at work, in peer groups, in public and also in private family life, or life with a partner. It takes many forms - from physical and sexual to mental and social, and even economic violence. It is experienced by women from different educational backgrounds, socio-economic positions, ethnic groups and religions, and by women from both urban and rural environments. It should be emphasised, however, that violence against women is a problem that we must all address. Eliminating it requires not only active institutions, but also active individuals - men and women - who do not turn a blind eye to this unpleasant phenomenon in our society, and who are willing to get involved personally in enforcing the principle of zero tolerance. The individual Member States must play a greater role in this, drawing up action plans for combating violence against women, boosting media awareness and adopting specific criminal laws and measures.
costep_2001-10-23_7_60	Mr President, I will pass on your answer to the chairman of the Committee on Budgets. He had asked me to wait for it. On a personal note, I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to our President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vande Lanotte, above all, who has been here with us throughout the whole of the discussions on the Budget. Things like that do not happen all the time. So, without wishing to seem presumptuous, I would again like to express my most heartfelt thanks to you, not only for showing us so much respect, but also for demonstrating your interest in working with us. Many thanks!
costep_2010-10-18_13_30	Madam President, we did not say that we advocated double standards. The European Commission has submitted a proposal for 18 weeks. We are proposing to introduce a bridging clause. As a basis, this is entirely possible, but there is a difference between what is possible and the Utopian idea of proposing 20 weeks on full pay; between what is feasible and what one can promise in Parliament, which will not be accepted by either the Council or the national parliaments. If we vote on Wednesday in favour of the Estrela report and the 20 weeks, the European Parliament will be disavowed three times: the first time by the Council, which will be unable to give its support - the Member States will be unable to give their support; the second time by the national parliaments - the national parliaments, with their budgets, will be unable to give their support; and the third time by women, when they realise that we have worked against them.
costep_2007-09-24_17_26	Thank you very much, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to welcome the fact that the inter-institutional Conciliation Committee has managed to reach agreement, and that the market in international rail passenger transport services within the European Union will therefore be opened up in 2010. Liberalisation is a good move (the President interrupted the speaker); open competition is a necessity in the passenger transport services market. It will not only contribute to implementing rail transport reform, but at the same time will create the kind of competitive situation in which the main winners will be the consumers themselves. However, we cannot just go straight ahead and force national rail companies into free market competition, since several Member States' rail companies are facing financial difficulties. In addition, their infrastructure is often exceptionally underdeveloped. We therefore need to support their development efforts and we must allow them time to become competitive so that they are able to hold their own in the battle to win passengers. Alongside liberalisation, it is at least as important to enhance passenger confidence in rail services by improving, extending and internationalising passenger rights. The new legislation means that rail service providers will have to assume greater responsibility. Harmonisation of EU legislation on the rights and obligations of passengers, information, assumption of liability for passengers and their luggage, the issue of compensation, handling of delays and provision for passengers with reduced mobility are all things that increase safety and at the same time enhance the reputation of rail service providers. It is an ambitious goal, but absolutely essential for facilitating development of the European high-speed rail network and cross-border operating arrangements relating to it. At the same time, it also increases confidence with regard to domestic rail passenger transport. Increasing efficiency and improving rail network and service quality are truly fundamental not only in terms of developing a sustainable transport sector but also in terms of overcrowding and air pollution. Of course, alongside the new legislative package, in the interests of improving quality we must also ensure that the directive is appropriately transposed into national law. In view of these issues, the implementation report due in 2012 will be especially important, as will the companies' annual reports. In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and all those who contributed to the success of the negotiations; thanks to you we will at last be able to vote on this issue tomorrow. Thank you very much for your attention.
costep_1999-09-13_7_3	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to express our full support for the report by Mrs Jackson. I believe that this is an important question. We have seen it happen, even if it is not the direct subject of this report, with the dioxin case. We can set up all the European directives, all the recommendations, all the laws that we want. If their application is not guaranteed by inspection, I believe that the grave doubts of our fellow citizens regarding European effectiveness and the value of these standards may well increase. We therefore need to establish control and inspection on a Community basis. Obviously, a fair balance between the responsibility of Member States and European intervention must be found. In this area, we support the request from Mrs Jackson not to limit ourselves to adopting recommendations, but to go on to the phase of an actual directive, which establishes precise criteria, which each of the Member States shall have to respect in its performance of inspections. We therefore support all the amendments, requesting the Commission to take note of the need to set strict frameworks. We have heard the new Commissioner, Mrs Wallström, whom we questioned on the matter of the effectiveness of laws. She stated the intention of the Commission to be stricter to ensure that, in the end, inspection is effective and its application strict. We therefore support adoption of the amendments by Parliament. After all, after the cases we have experienced with dioxin, we can clearly see the risk we face. We can progress in a reasonable and strict manner towards effective European inspection of Member States, within the framework of a European vision. But the second phase is the creation of European inspectors - I might call them super-inspectors - who will be able to check the proper performance of Member State inspections. If we do not do this, when the first crisis comes along, given the lack of inspection in a Member State and the lack of a European principle on inspection, we shall resort to an independent agency which must be created in order to manage the question of food, for example, as we have seen when debating this matter. I think that this is not the correct response. The proper response is inspection, control, regulations, managed politically by the representative authorities of the Union, and in which the European Parliament must have entire responsibility. We therefore would request the Commission to heed the proposals of the Jackson report both to go on to issue a directive but, at the same time, to finally initiate a new phase as regards Community inspection.
costep_2000-03-29_11_4	Mr President, our honourable friend, Mr MacCormick, has made a thorough and critical appraisal of the Green Paper on civil liability for defective products and he deserves our thanks for his work and for his cooperative contribution. I should just like to make a few more comments on behalf of my group on a number of necessary amendments on which both we and the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party reached extensive agreement in the run-up. I refer to the checks which your department needs to carry out, Commissioner Bolkestein, and the question of the burden of proof which, according to Article 4, rests solely on the injured party. My group believes the Commission should check if prima facie evidence and circumstantial evidence can also be taken into account at all levels at which evidence is taken. This is particularly important because the product world is becoming more and more complex and it is becoming more and more difficult for individual persons who have suffered damage to provide proof in this area. There is also the question of derogations from general manufacturer’s liability, especially the so-called development risk. We need to examine if these derogations are expedient and conducive to the balance between manufacturers and consumers. This applies in particular in the case of foodstuffs and medication. We do not want to see the consumer alone bear the risks inherent in technical progress. In my view, applying the directive solely to private use and consumption is a questionable move. The Commission should consider if the directive should not be extended to commercial goods. The material damage sustained by a company is, in principle, no different from the material damage sustained by a private individual. And the smaller the enterprise, the heavier the burden of this unequal treatment. Harmonisation of laws at Community level would be in keeping with the purpose of the product liability directive, especially as increasing flexibility in the world of work is tending more and more to blur the clear distinction between the private world and the world of work. We also need to think about the way in which liability is statute-barred. It is clear from the case of BSE that a standard ten-year limitation on liability may be insufficient under certain circumstances. We could perhaps consider gearing the limitation period to the type of product. However, it is not only these individual points which are important; we also need to seize every opportunity to harmonise product liability still further in the form of comprehensive consumer protection in the European Union. If we supplement the MacCormick report in this direction, the European Parliament will have done a good job in the eyes of the consumer. Which is why we have been elected.
costep_2008-01-16_14_13	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was delighted to listen to the words of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, and I was delighted by the initiatives that can be expected to take place in future. I feel that this really will help the situation of the Roma substantially, but I must agree with my Dutch fellow Member, who has expressed her impatience. I am impatient too, along with many others, because the situation really is changing very slowly. There are 7-9 million Roma living in Europe, most of them in poor social circumstances, and they fight the same problems as they have for years: the problems of exclusion and inclusion, the lack of employment, the question of school segregation and multiple discrimination against Roma women. The majority of Member States do not regard the Roma as a minority of their country, they do not want to make substantial changes to their situation, and indeed the experiences of the past few years have shown instead a reinforcement of radicalism and anti-gipsyism in both the new and old Member States. I therefore feel that there is no more time to waste, and we need real changes and a harmonised European Roma policy. Without a European Roma policy there is no national Roma policy; we have to understand and confront this. It would be good if we took steps so that the transnational minority status of the Roma is recognised, since it really is a special status. The European Parliament and, within this, the Socialist Group, has already launched the action plan, and in March we will be doing a tour of Europe and arranging conferences, workshops and visits with the involvement of local Roma, NGOs and governments in order to expose cases of discrimination, and we will draw the attention of European public opinion to the unhappy situation of the Roma and try to remedy it. Thank you very much.
costep_1999-02-09_5_11	I congratulate the Commission on their initiative and our colleague Caroline Jackson on this report - nobody can fail to be aware of this subject. Special mention is made of concern for the quality of life in urban areas, and the demand for a minimum distance between landfills and residential or recreational areas is understandable. That distance should obviously be several kilometres and this should be an immediate issue for all governments - sadly this is not the case with the Portuguese government - when dealing with toxic waste incineration or coincineration. It is unacceptable, given that it cannot seriously be claimed that there is no risk, that people’s lives and health are being put at risk, thus violating their rights. Castricum report A4-0025/99
costep_2000-03-16_1_6	Mr President, this is the third debate on the EU-Mexico agreement and, given that it is the most comprehensive agreement which the European Union has ever concluded with a third country, the principles that mark the sort of cooperation which will be viable in the future should not be thrown to the wind. Both we and the people of Mexico set great store by this agreement. They see it as a chance to correct their one-way dependence on NAFTA. They believe that, in the EU, they have found a partner which stands for democracy, human rights and social and ecological development. Today we have analysed the contract and found that the agreement with the EU not only creates the same sort of relationship as with NAFTA, but that, in parts, it is even worse. Like the rightly failed MAI, freedom of investment, reproduced bilaterally, does nothing to foster a democratically-controlled economy geared to local development. Placing no limit on opening public procurement merely allows large suppliers to swallow up small suppliers all over the world. Provisions such as domestic treatment and bans on conditions cut companies which, for example, prefer to employ women or engage in environmentally sound production, out of the running. The EU has kept derogations open for itself here. Mexico has none! Here is another shortcoming in comparison with NAFTA: the latter has an agreement on employees' rights with a sanction mechanism, while the EU agreement has not even heard of the Social Pact of the United Nations. However, the opposite applies to trade disputes, for which a dispute settlement mechanism is provided together with the possibility of sanctions. We know from the WTO that environmental laws are regularly sidelined as the result of such disputes. A free trade agreement at the cost of the Mexicans. It was under this banner that the Mexican civil society called a few days ago for the Senate to improve the agreement and not to rush into signing it. Some points even contradict the Mexican constitution. We are not globalphobes' they write at the end, but we want globalisation which benefits mankind and a fair world order without social exclusion. We here in the European Parliament do not oppose an agreement with Mexico. On the contrary! We are unable, however, to vote in favour of this agreement for the reasons stated and must continue to fight for better agreements in the future. One last word: we need a critical voice here in Parliament which continues to support the rightful concerns and demands of Mexican society.
costep_1999-11-16_9_20	Commissioner, there are at least 47 very important countries, such as the United States and many countries of the Commonwealth, which are maintaining the embargo on British meat. The question I would like to put, following the decision you made today, is this: will you get to the very bottom of this? And will you ask, for example, the World Trade Organisation to state that it is against this embargo? I think that this is a very important question. Secondly, yesterday, the President of the Court of Auditors presented his annual report to us in which he points out serious deficiencies in the keeping of the registers of bovine cattle in Great Britain. Did you take this into account today when you made your decision?
costep_2001-11-29_2_49	I congratulate Mrs Foster on her excellent report, which I fully support. This is a piece of work that demonstrates considerable technical understanding in addressing an issue of crucial importance for the future of civil aviation and in respect of which I should like to emphasise the following points: the need for the Member States to commit themselves to drawing up a comprehensive policy for financing security in air travel, which must be entirely under government control, because security threats against aviation are a manifestation of threats against the state; the need to pass a number of common laws in the field of civil aviation under the terms of the agreements concluded at the European Civil Aviation Conference, as a means of increasing airport security in the European Union.
costep_2010-12-15_6_3	Madam President, today the European Union is opening up to participatory democracy. It is not yet direct democracy, citizens will not take the decisions themselves, but they do win the right to question directly, publicly, in huge numbers, those who take the decisions in Europe, over the head of their government and their elected representatives. From now on, the citizens will enjoy the same power of political initiative as that enjoyed here by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. We have benefited, as Mrs Gurmai has said, from the excellent preparatory work carried out by Commissioner Šefčovič and his teams, and from the intelligent and efficient support by the Belgian Presidency. On the part of Parliament, the text is the result of the work of four rapporteurs, a gang of four, including you, Madam President. We are honoured by your presence. We wanted to come up with the simplest, most citizen-friendly procedure for the public. Who might participate? Citizens, that is to say natural persons, all citizens, including, possibly, elected representatives, but only European citizens. The Treaty leaves no doubt on the subject. The right to participate in the citizens' initiative is now yet one more of the privileges enjoyed by citizens throughout Europe. Who might launch the initiative? It only needs seven citizens in an organising committee, not 300 000 as the Commission proposed, nor 100 000 as the Council envisaged, seven citizens from seven different countries, that is a quarter of the Member States. Who should be contacted for information if one wants to launch an initiative? The Commission itself will publish a guide to the citizens' initiative and will set up a specialised point of contact. What is the procedure? Extraordinarily simple. A single request to register the initiative and check its admissibility. The criteria for admissibility? The Treaty, the whole Treaty and nothing but the Treaty, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights. What support can be used for an initiative? Any kind of support: political, financial, local, national, European, international, lobbies, NGOs, churches, and so on. Just one condition: total transparency. Those who are invited to sign must know what lies behind the initiative. So it is up to the citizens to assume their responsibilities. What are the formalities for collecting the signatures? Incredibly simple. Signatures on paper but also through the Internet. Of course, it is only the Member States that can monitor them, but we have been careful, as Mrs Gurmai has said, to ensure that the forms are harmonised to the greatest possible extent. In the long term, it is a veritable single European system which will have to be adopted in all 27 countries and a third of Member States are already prepared for it. Finally, what will the political outcomes be? This is a point on which Parliament has been very insistent. Indeed, in accordance with the Treaty, the Commission will be the only judge of whether or not to provide legislative follow-up to a successful initiative. Therefore the Commission must be protected against political pressure seeking to make legislation proliferate at a time when the Union already regulates too much. However, at the same time, the citizens must be protected against the risk that there is no political follow-up in cases where the Commission deems supplementary legislation inappropriate. Hence the creation of two new rights to benefit authors of successful initiatives: the right to be received by the Commission to present their motion and the right to a public hearing, which can take place before the European Parliament itself. In short, here we have a simple, innovative, democratic procedure. It is now the citizens' turn to take the floor. Applause
costep_2011-06-23_14_392	This report is part of the legislative package on economic governance and is one of its key elements. It is the regulation on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure. While it starts from the premise that there is a crisis in the euro area and a need for a comprehensive and integrated solution to the debt crisis in the euro area, given the lack of success of the fragmented approach used until now, the report ends up calling for the same type of monetarist and neoliberal policies and criteria that led to the crisis. It reiterates and tightens the veritable stranglehold imposed on the Member States, without a care for the causes of the problems, or for alternative policies that take into account economies' different levels of development. As such, instead of proposing a pact for progress and social development founded on solidarity and on genuine policies of economic and social cohesion, as we have been advocating, it calls for a deepening of the Stability and Growth Pact and, now, the Euro-Plus Pact. It expands and reinforces application of sanctions and payment of fines for Member States that do not comply with the impositions. This is unacceptable interference, which puts Member States subjected to this excessive deficit procedure in a position of veritable colonial-style submission to the European powers.
costep_2007-07-09_16_11	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the action programme on health and the prevention of cardiovascular disease are very closely related subjects. I would like first of all to offer Mr Trakatellis my sincere congratulations on his tireless fight for this programme. Prevention is better than cure. Prevention means longer life, better life, better quality of life, less medical care, less sickness, lower sickness costs. I am sure we would have liked more resources than 20 cents per head of population per year. We are however modest and conduct many action programmes for little money. We can only set priorities of course, and I must make it absolutely clear that we are talking here about prevention, about educating people, and not about treatment, which after all is a subsidiary matter and the responsibility of the nation states. Prevention means stopping diseases from occurring in the first place, especially in the area of cardiovascular diseases, involving heart attacks and strokes, of tumour diseases and their causes, as with lung cancer and smoking, of unhealthy lifestyles such as the wrong kind of food or even doping in sport, of accidents and accident prevention, and of research and statistics, where the aim is to detect and understand diseases better in order to develop better guidelines for treatment. I will now reply to the oral question from Mr Ouzký, to whom I also express my thanks here. Much can be done to prevent cardiovascular disease by changing one’s lifestyle: exercise, health, sport, balanced nutrition and ultimately also avoiding trans fatty acids. We also need a catchy slogan for cardiovascular prevention, so that people know what is at stake. We could say, for example, 'Save your heart, save your life' or in German 'Herzlos kannst du nicht leben'. EUR 325 million for prevention over five years is not much. I visited a German heart hospital this morning. There, 200 million were invested in just one year!
costep_2009-09-15_11_60	Madam President, Mr Barroso, I might as well say it straight away: you did not convince the French socialists for five years, and you are not succeeding in convincing us now with a project in which you are as generous in word as you are general in purpose. How can you say to us 'vote for me if you want a Europe that is united in its diversity', when it is precisely because we want this Europe that we are recommending waiting for the Irish vote so as to vote on your candidacy? Armed with the support of the Member States, you preferred to secure your appointment ahead of time and with fewer risks as regards the number of votes required. You thought that the passage before Parliament would be a mere formality: it is not so, and this is just the beginning, for your response does not meet the expectations of the citizens, who are suffering in the crisis and who have demonstrated their anger towards our institutions through their low turnout. You say that the crisis has changed you and you pose as the great navigator of a united Europe, but you have not been able to guide the Member States towards a truly European recovery plan, and we are still awaiting the concrete and binding measures needed for financial regulation. You claim to have given us guarantees regarding the social agenda, but all you are advocating is a new regulation, not a review of the Posting of Workers Directive. Moreover, you have not made a firm, and above all clear, commitment on a directive protecting public services. You show contempt for the MEPs' memory of events. We have not forgotten that, over the last five years, social issues have never been at the heart of the proposed solutions, and it is only now that you are agreeing to a social impact study for each piece of European legislation. In a period of unprecedented crisis, which is destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs, everything must be done to ensure that the number of European unemployed workers or working poor does not reach 25 million by 2010. For this we need an industrial policy to be adopted. The citizens need to be set an example of solidarity in order to combat the crisis. Neither in your words nor in your declared ambition for Europe will they find this impetus today. To carry on as before is disastrous, said the philosopher, Walter Benjamin. You still have a very long way to go to win over the socialists and the social democrats. For the sake of political consistency and out of respect for our electorate, we shall not vote for you.
costep_2001-09-04_11_19	Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I should like to congratulate the Commission and particularly the Commissioner on the various important initiatives being put forward for this sector. I should also like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Collins and Mr Schmitt, on their magnificent work and mention one idea that I feel is particularly important in this matter. The passenger protection dossier is, together with the single sky, safety and protection of the environment, an important dossier for air transport, for passengers and also for the image of European integration in the eyes of the public. We are all aware of the importance of this means of transport and also of the contradiction that exists between the Europe of the air and terrestrial Europe: whilst traditional borders are disappearing, we are seeing these borders persist in the air transport sector. Initiatives such as those that we are now discussing are, therefore, of great importance to the European public. I come from the Balearic Islands, where dependence on the aeroplane is, as you all know, extremely high. I know what it is to suffer airport chaos or interminable delays. I therefore welcome the Commission’s intention to seek a balance between legislation and the voluntary commitments affecting airlines, airports and airport authorities, not to mention the tourist industry. This is an ambitious communication, which seeks to achieve this balance between the needs to establish guarantees for passengers and to ensure that air transport is efficient and competitive. We must get the message across to users and make them fully aware of their rights, which are recognised by law when problems with flights occur. I regret the impasse in which many initiatives in this sector are trapped within the Council and I hope that the appropriate agreements will be concluded so that we can move ahead without any further delay. In the wake and in commemoration of the terrible accident that befell an aircraft en route from the Spanish city of Melilla, I should like to conclude by congratulating the Commission and Mr Schmitt on their work on the proposal to establish the European Aviation Safety Agency. Reports such as the one by Mr Schmitt will be able, if not to prevent, which is impossible, to considerably reduce the number of these terrible accidents.
costep_2003-06-19_4_52	Through its Cohesion Fund, the priority objective for the promotion of economic and social cohesion, the European Union has contributed to the fight against regional imbalances in the Member States. Because the Portuguese GNP is less than 90% of the Community average, since accession the country’s infrastructure has benefited from an unprecedented leap forward, particularly in the environmental (management of water resources) and transport (railways) areas. With enlargement on the doorstep, it is becoming increasingly important to use the available funds effectively and rationally, to submit high quality projects and to meet realistic timetables. As argued in this report, I support stricter control of fund applications on the ground, a more detailed assessment of the impact of the funds, sanctions for irregularities and the recovery of sums unduly paid out. These are measures that will help to enhance transparency. It should be remembered that macroeconomic criteria, especially the increase in the public-sector deficit, affect the allocation of Community funds. Portugal’s 4.1% deficit in 2001 raised the question of the possible suspension of funding. This report refers to Portugal as the only Member State in this situation! In this connection, I should like to state here my clear support for the rigorous budgetary measures currently being developed in my country, despite the harsh criticism that they have attracted.
costep_1999-10-06_1_7	Madam President, in his speech at the formal opening of the new legal year in Turkey on 6 September, the Senior Judge of the Supreme Court of Appeal, Sami Selçuk, strongly denounced the country’s constitution. With the words, Turkey is a country with a constitution but it is not a constitutional state, he condemned the Turkish constitution. The constitution apparently protected the rights of the state at the expense of the freedom of the citizens. We need more democracy and more citizens who are allowed freedom of thought without being restricted by the laws of the land, said the judge. He spoke in favour of widespread democratic reform and also fundamental restructuring of the political system. He is right. His demands are identical to our expectations. I am even convinced that the majority in this House is also in favour of a democratic Turkey, in which human rights and minority rights are respected. It is my conviction, too, that we are bound to support democratic circles and their modest successes not just on moral grounds but also because a democratic Turkey, which can solve its own problems within Turkey, will be advantageous for the internal security of the European Union. By means of our policy we could make a contribution towards ensuring that the proponents of a European democracy in Turkey may be successful and that the hawks who are against Europe may be the losers. In other words, at the present time, we need a policy which assists Turkey whilst maintaining a critical attitude and a policy which induces it to settle obvious issues such as the Kurdish question, the Cyprus issue or the human rights problems speedily and humanely. This cannot be the policy of the exclusion or the isolation of Turkey! Therefore, whatever the timetable or the exact procedure, in Helsinki a sign must be given towards the people of Turkish and Kurdish origin and towards democracy in Turkey. I cannot as yet say anything for sure on behalf of my group on the integration of Turkey, because we are still having discussions, but for me personally, it means as Mr Verheugen has already said, that it has candidate status for accession to the European Union. Its integration is urgently necessary, not just for the democratisation of Turkey, but also for peace and stability in the Balkans and in South-Eastern Europe. The Greek Foreign Minister Papandreou yesterday said at the University of Istanbul, We want Turkey in the European Union right now! Nothing further need be said! I think he made it perfectly clear!
costep_2010-02-24_19_34	I fully support Mrs Svensson’s work on the problem of gender equality, and I agree that the issues she has raised have a significant influence on the process of achieving equal rights for women and men. At the same time, I would like to point out that many women consciously and freely choose to work in the home on behalf of the family. Sometimes they are forced to give up their career for unforeseen reasons, such as the need to care for an ill or disabled child. A significant problem in this situation is the lack of appropriate solutions concerning retirement pension entitlements for these women. In many countries, there are no solutions at all in this area, or those which are in place are not sufficient to ensure women a decent living. Therefore, it is essential, too, that the debate on gender equality should also include the matter of the entitlement to benefits of women who run the home and care for children.
costep_2009-11-25_13_22	Mr President, in recent years, initiatives in support of eliminating violence against women have multiplied. Unfortunately, this phenomenon continues to exist in Europe, irrespective of the age of the women, their education or their social position. We must, therefore, continue to stress that violence against women is neither natural nor unavoidable. Violence against women, everywhere in the world, is quite simply a crime and a violation of the right to life, personal dignity, safety, and physical and mental inviolability. Talking about violence is not just presenting women as victims but, above all, involves the necessity of condemning the act of violence itself and its perpetrator, who should not go unpunished. We need long-term education of women and men which will remove stereotypes and make everyone understand the need to fight this phenomenon.
costep_2009-03-24_5_97	Dialogue with citizens is an important and complex matter, but it is something the ruling governments must master well. That is the essence of their work: dialogue ending in compromise. In this context it appears that the background to this report is to some extent contradictory. It calls for us to complete the process of ratifying the Lisbon Treaty as soon as possible, as it is an important condition for dialogue on Europe. The report claims that the Treaty will increase transparency and involve citizens in decision making. It may give the impression that those who do not like the Treaty will be ignored, and therefore their voice will not be heard. It is therefore hard to speak of dialogue and compromise. The idea of 'common European knowledge' through the study of the history of Europe and European integration is also controversial. This would be brought about by a programme agreed at Community level, adopted on a voluntary basis by the Member States and paid for from the Community budget. In short, this is an historical compromise, which will serve as a tool for building common European values. In my view we do not need to go that far - historical compromise is a concept that is vague at the very least, if such a compromise is needed at all. Furthermore, using history as a means to an end arouses opposition, even if the intention behind it is sincere. The key to effective dialogue lies in the present day, which has brought us enough problems anyway. We need to talk! In other words: 'yes' to dialogue, and 'no' to the report.
costep_2010-10-20_15_26	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we enthusiastically support this regulation, and should like to thank the rapporteur Mrs Muscardini, as well as Mr Susta and Mr Rinaldi. I, too, am of the belief that this measure represents an intermediate step. We must decide whether or not it is right that, when buying a product, a consumer knows where it has been made. We feel that it is right. This is a regulation that works towards transparency and the protection of consumer rights. It matters little to us right now if, in order to protect the rights of transparency and clarity for consumers, some business that has relocated finds itself penalised in some way. I listened carefully to the words of my Swedish colleague, Mr Fjellner, who hails from Stockholm, to whom I feel the need to respond that I would like to have the confidence to go to his country to buy a typical Swedish-made suit in the certainty that it really was made in Sweden. This is because it could have the brand of a Swedish business even though it has been produced by a small manufacturing business, perhaps located 10 kilometres from my house. I should feel quite a fool if I went all the way to Sweden to buy something that was produced in my local area. Therefore, I welcome the mark of origin if it gives transparency and the chance of clarity and knowledge for consumers and, finally, a minimal response to the great many businesses that have had the courage not to relocate and have been crushed by unfair competition.
costep_2005-06-23_1_63	Mr President, I was very interested in the reference made by the Prime Minister in his speech this morning to the Europe of values. And, as well as this legitimate vision, there is another complementary vision of Europe (I would be grateful if Mr Blair could put on his headphones), there is another legitimate Europe which is complementary to the former, which is the Europe of the tangible, the Europe of hard cash, and the Europe of the net contribution and the net beneficiary, and the Europe of the British rebate. I am pleased that you believe that we in Europe no longer see ourselves simply as consumers in a big market, but as citizens of the Union. There is a qualitative social leap from the notion of a consumer to that of a citizen and from the notion of a common market to that of a project of political union. It is clear that leadership is needed in order to propel the project in the right direction, in order to bring Europe closer to the citizens, in order to recover the path of sustainable growth and job creation and in order to give Europe a role on the international stage in accordance with its economic, commercial, financial and industrial weight. Europe, Prime Minister, is not the problem, it is the solution. And we need more Europe rather than less Europe. And the important thing is to move on from words to actions. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is important to move on from words to actions and leave behind purely rhetorical statements, because you have signed a document reducing the European Union’s ambitions and budgetary resources. Or do you believe, Mr President-in-Office, that we are going to be able to deal with the priority of doubling funds for Africa if we have less resources? Do you believe that we are going to be able to deal with the priority of introducing the necessary economic reforms if we have less resources? Do you believe that we are going to be able to deal with the challenges facing the European Union with less resources? Mr President, I wish the British Presidency the best of luck in its task of bringing together wills and creating consensus so that the European Union can move forward, but it will only be able to do so on the basis of two perspectives or two premises: firstly, by providing the money required to realise our ideals; and secondly, Mr President, by everybody seeking advantage on the basis of a common advantage.
costep_2003-03-12_3_33	Mr President, will we have to resort to arms in order to make Saddam Hussein give up his programmes for the development, manufacture and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction once and for all and prove that he has done so? I am one of those who still hope that we can avoid doing so and, like Mr Pasqua, I should like to say here and now that I applaud the efforts that France and its government are making to this end. I also share the opinion of those who maintain that, if we had to envisage this last resort, it could only be with a mandate from the United Nations, the only organisation which is entitled to legitimise such action, and that, Mr Barón Crespo, would betoken a radical change in the behaviour of the international community, which until now has always supported the idea that the use of armed force can only be envisaged in the case of legitimate defence, and therefore in response to an actual attack ? Ladies and gentlemen, we initiated the reflection on this subject in our previous debates. Obviously, we have not found a final answer to this question. However, I should like to remind you that it was on this subject, namely the legitimacy or illegitimacy of any preventive or pre-emptive military action, that our group was unwilling to support the majority position expressed by this House in its last resolution. In other words, President-in-Office of the Council, how can we stand up to the new challenge posed by international terrorism except by applying, in this field as in any other, the precautionary principle which is now unanimously recognised? Personally, I believe that any Head of State or Government who is warned of a serious threat to the lives of thousands of his fellow citizens, and who does not take all measures necessary to protect them from it, will be held guilty in their eyes. Weapons of mass destruction constitute a real threat to the survival and health of populations. Every time that the existence of such a threat is confirmed, I believe that it will be the duty of the authorities to remove it, without waiting for it to be implemented, by preventive, diplomatic, economic and political measures and, if those measures are not enough, by the ultimate recourse to the use of military power. This is what we are all, together, trying to achieve in Iraq, and what it will probably be necessary for us to do tomorrow in North Korea, and it is with that conviction in mind that I would like to repeat, here and now, that our current differences are much more apparent than real.
costep_2000-06-15_2_43	Mr President, I can imagine that a number of MEPs who were against this directive at the time are now satisfied with it. I think that congratulations are in order for Mr Lechner. It is fortunate that the directive which we voted on yesterday is so different in nature that we really do not need to expect a similar kind of judgement from the Advocate-General or from the Court. Yesterday’s directive is based on three existing directives, two of which have already been before the Court. I am therefore completely satisfied with the vote as it was held yesterday.
costep_1999-11-03_11_5	Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my great satisfaction with this initiative, which is clearly an important step in the direction of transparency of information with regard to the environmental characteristics of cars and, in this respect, it will aid consumer choice. Nevertheless, I would like briefly to refer to the factor which gives rise to this directive: the energy efficiency of cars. This doubled, effectively, between 1973 and 1986. Consumption decreased, during this period, from 17.8 to 8.7 litres per 100 kilometres. During this same period, the stricter provision of equipment contributed to a 4% saving and the use of a lighter chassis led to the remaining 96%. Nevertheless, since 1986, fuel efficiency has increased by a mere 10%. In our opinion, this is due to the fact that technological development systems used in the car industry impede global improvements in the product as a result of the high level of specialisation of companies' R and D laboratories. These laboratories - which are often physically a long way from each other and lack a coordination and communication strategy between them - invest a lot in improving very specific features of cars, and very little in improving the car as a system for moving from one place to another. To this end - and since directives such as the one which we are discussing today have been very well received - I believe that the European Parliament must promote and support initiatives which are aimed at an integrated product policy in which the R and D in design, in this case of cars, receives all the attention it deserves. I believe that unless we deal with production in an integrated way, that is, from the moment that the car’s raw materials are selected, through its manufacture, the production process, the use and finally the recycling and final disposal of the car when the buyer is no longer using it, we will never really manage to introduce measures which are genuinely significant in the field of reducing green-house gases. I think that only in this way will we ensure that the car stops squandering between 80 and 85% - just imagine! - of the energy before it even takes to the road. Therefore, I believe that this list we are talking about of the ten most efficient cars could also be, if we carry on like this, the list of the least inefficient, and in no sense will it be the list of the best.
costep_2001-02-28_9_2	I would like to start by thanking the Commissioner, for this report has come back to the Committee on Development and Cooperation a number of times and this has contributed to enriching the debate within the committee. I would also like to thank the Chairman of the committee and all the group coordinators, and all the Members who have contributed to the preparation of this report, taking up, with great sensitivity, my invitation to make this report a document which compels broad consensus and a broad majority in Parliament, reflecting all the positions expressed by the European Parliament. Lastly, I would also like to thank the draftspeople of the other committees: Mrs Carrilho of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mrs Haug of the Committee on Budgets, Mrs Lucas of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and Mrs Sörensen of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, who have contributed their opinions to this report. The report is based on a number of fundamental principles: restoring the balance of nature in order to protect the environment; protecting the food chain as a way of protecting the ecosystem; developing a self-sufficient, sustainable economy; restricting exploitative industrial monocultures; and then, restoring the balance of nature also in terms of anthropological progress and responsible relationships between man and woman, adult and child, workers and elderly people, based on a unit of society made of a man, a woman and children. Another principle is that of responsible, self-administered development, as a cultural factor, of the need for, and the development of a higher standard of living: projects which are self-created, in order to promote the development of local culture and help people to look beyond customs originating from local culture; then awareness of the role of the institutions and the need to involve the private sector in programmes encouraging development; lastly, great, very great attention to the world of children, who, in the political world, are an invisible group of society with no voice or rights; moreover, a powerful role for women, recognising the role that women have always had in society, starting with the family and the work place. It was with on the basis of these guidelines that the debate on the European Commission’s communication took place. We found the debate somewhat simplistic compared to what ought to be the European Union’s perspectives within this world of development. And so, since it has not been possible to produce a coherent report on such a complex work, I feel simply that I must say that the conditions of poor people are worse today than in 1960, that is 40 years ago, that the number of children in school has fallen and that people are not being considered as individuals, as individual people, but that all the poor people in the world are being lumped together as one economic statistic. Debt is also an issue which can and must be tackled, provided that we succeed in monitoring the States' budgets in order to reclassify budget items and dedicate them to the eradication of poverty. Similarly, rural development must be improved, properly valued and increased, apart from anything else to offset the rush to build huge cities. Then, with regard to conflict prevention, I feel that this issue has been dealt with more or less exhaustively in Mrs Carrilho’s opinion on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and that it too can be tackled through the regionalisation of development policy. I would stress one further point. It would appear that there is a tendency to attempt to deal with the issues of development and eradicating poverty by entrusting this task to the multinationals. I do not feel that the multinationals are the right organisations for the task. Rather, the role of the NGOs, who should have a direct relationship with the peoples of developing countries, should be strengthened. In conclusion, I do not know whether this report will enable us to deal with these issues, but I do know that there are many children, women and men in need of our help, and we must protect them.
costep_2006-11-30_4_6	Mr President, Commissioner, you rightly pointed out that, in spite of the as yet minimal progress made when it comes to access to treatment, the disease is, unfortunately, not on the decline. On the contrary: in our own countries, in particular, the epidemic has, rather, gained ground. We are therefore delighted about the consensus taking shape in this House concerning the need definitely to review the TRIPS agreement on access to medicines, since the arrangements provided for within the framework of the Doha round do not, unfortunately, at present permit real access to inexpensive medicines. That being said, the problem of AIDS is not only a problem of funding and of access to medicines. It might even be said that the emphasis placed on access to medicines has no doubt eclipsed the need to go on ceaselessly promoting prevention, which is now in decline both in our own countries and everywhere else. It is therefore essential to resume the prevention and information campaigns via the media, enlisting the help of qualified personnel, as well as on the social and medical networks, with a view to raising people’s awareness. Secondly - and this is something that you have pointed out and something that is no doubt the most difficult thing to achieve - we also need, if we are really to change the situation, to alter cultural practices when it comes to sexuality and, in particular, to protect women and enable women to protect themselves. Women now constitute 50% of patients, which was not the case at the beginning of the epidemic. They are also affected in an extremely brutal and violent way not only by cruel treatment and other practices that take place in time of war in conflict zones but also by rape, prostitution, trafficking in women and female sexual slavery - all scourges that help facilitate the growth of the epidemic. Consequently, the way in which the European Union promotes women’s rights and equality also constitutes a very effective way of combating the epidemic and focusing on the transmission of the disease from mother to child - a mode of transmission that is rarely mentioned at present. Innovative solutions do exist in some countries - for example, Malawi - where, by proceeding on the basis of decentralisation so as to get closer to the people and by also arranging for an active role to be played by the patients themselves - those whose condition has been stabilised - extremely positive results are achieved. This even applies in extremely poverty-stricken countries. We must therefore make much further progress on all these levels.
costep_2010-12-13_15_2	Mr President, last month, I organised a hearing in this Parliament concerning the victims of terrorism, which was attended by the President of Parliament and various Members of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). The victims have turned to us, as their representatives in Europe, to guarantee them their right to justice which has been trampled on so many times in their own countries, such as Spain, where the Rodríguez Zapatero Government continues to lie to the Spanish people about a negotiation process with a terrorist group which has still not relinquished its arms. It is because of this that such grave incidents as the Bar Faisán tip off, in which the terrorists were warned of the operation in progress to arrest them, have still not been thoroughly investigated. Democratic governments cannot turn their backs on the victims of terrorism; they have already paid the highest price in the fight for liberty. Parliament must push for a European Charter which recognises the legitimate demands of the victims, such as not negotiating with terrorists and ensuring that they serve their prison sentences in full.
costep_2002-05-16_4_126	The situation in Madagascar is getting worse, despite efforts by international organisations and the successive promises made by the two leaders. The country has now been divided and its capital is in danger of being cut off from the rest of the country, with all that implies for the people. This situation takes me back ten years, when I faced the beginnings of the drama which, for four long years, was to make the life of the people in Bosnia-Herzegovina hell, with barricades going up everywhere to mark out territories and the gradual partition of the country into zones in which warlords reigned supreme. And today we are watching as this island is caught in the grip of the same hellish spiral. That is why I call on Mr Ratsiraka and Mr Ravalomanana from this House to each agree, before it is too late, to make the concessions needed to avoid the worst. The European Community does, of course, support the efforts being made by the Organisation of African Unity and by President Wade within it. The resolution on which Parliament is shortly to vote therefore calls on the two parties to apply all the terms of the Dakar agreement of 18 April which, unfortunately, has yet to be implemented. In the same spirit, it calls on the Commission and the Council to do whatever they can to ensure that negotiations resume including, if necessary, sending a field mission of mediators and negotiators.
costep_2004-11-16_1_120	I speak as a representative of the New Italian Socialist Party. On 5 June 2003, the Council voted unanimously to impose political sanctions on the Cuban regime, following the indictment of 75 dissidents and the death sentence imposed on three citizens who had tried to flee to the United States. This event unfortunately fits into a general picture of continued and repeated violations and negation of fundamental freedoms in Cuba, as also confirmed recently by COLAT. Fidel Castro’s regime, which is in severe difficulty following growing internal and international pressure, is becoming more and more oppressive and repressive, in particular towards the younger generation, which dreams of a future of freedom, true democracy and development, a new and open horizon, incompatible with the current communist establishment. Europe should therefore pursue the firm path it has embarked upon, taking particular care, however, to avoid at all costs any further negative repercussions for the population, with the aim of laying the foundations for a productive and renewed dialogue free of resentment between the Cuban people and Europe in the period after Fidel Castro: friends of Cuba, friends of the Cubans, enemies of all dictators.
costep_1998-01-15_8_30	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament’s view is clear and unambiguous. The dignity of mankind forbids any form of cloning. In the vote on the 5th Research Framework Programme we also refused the provision of funds for research which amounts to human cloning. Respect for our fellow creatures as well as other considerations also make the cloning of animals a extremely questionable endeavour at the very least. Today, reports on a money-hungry madman who calls himself a scientist are forcing us to hold this debate for clarification. This clarification is required to ensure that one perverse case of abuse does not discredit the entire field of biotechnology which we associate with hopes and high expectations. But there is also a question which we must ask ourselves. Have we done everything we can to ensure that this new area of research and technology does not slip out of our control and direct itself against men or even mankind? We have certainly tried. Today we have before us a network of laws and guidelines which regulate and protect but which also offer loopholes and hiding places which could lead to the abuse of biotechnology. It is my view, therefore, that a framework guideline is needed which marks out the field and makes the many individual rules transparent. It must cover all aspects of the issue, including uniform provisions in criminal law which impose severe penalties on the flouting of regulations and violation of bans. This difficult work is our duty as citizens of the European Union. We must not dodge it. We must ask the Member States to sign a Council of Europe document today. On one hand, the so-called Bioethics Convention fails to solve the problem. On the other, it offers the principle of subsidiarity under which each Member State may decide whether or not to ratify it. For this reason let us remove Point 2 from the joint resolution.
costep_2011-06-08_7_685	Europe 2020 is the European strategy seeking to respond to the new global challenges for the EU and its various Member States, so it is important to structure the economic and financial conditions which will guide its application in the 2014-2021 period. This report aims to contribute to setting out the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), approving a 5% increase in budget appropriations on the current MFF, the maintenance of funding for cohesion and agriculture, and a financial strengthening of the areas of research, development and innovation, and of energy and transport. I voted in favour of the report since I view the strategic content as a positive and, overall, since the budget is in line with the objectives enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy. The strengthening of economic governance and the importance of cohesion policy are some of the areas that I would like to emphasise in the pursuit of a smarter, more sustainable and more inclusive Europe. I consider it important to create an intermediate category for regions whose per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is between 75% and 90% of EU GDP, thus contributing to increased equality at regional level. However, I would like to stress that this new category should not harm the more disadvantaged regions in terms of the allocation of EU funding.
costep_2010-05-05_19_18	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that we are here discussing and examining the content of this Europe 2020 strategy, while in Athens workers are dying, and a country, a nation is on the edge of a precipice, paints a rather telling, or, I would go so far as to say, grotesque, picture of European politics. It is absolutely remarkable that in a situation of this kind, the Commission does not feel that it should take a good, long look at itself, because it is not as though it does not realise that this crisis, which in some respects has now reached, I would say, dramatic proportions, is a consequence of many serious mistakes, as demonstrated by the failure of the Lisbon strategy. Many mistakes and one defendant in the dock: the euro. You come here saying, in all your statements, that Greece is a one-off, but will you be saying that when - although let us hope not - another similar situation arises, for example in Spain: will that be another one-off? We here are a bit tired of hearing the one-off excuse: the subprime crisis was also a one-off. It is hard to believe and very difficult to accept what the Commission is saying when the European Union has not yet decided to clean up Europe’s banks and to tell savers, manufacturers and the real economy how much muck there still is in European banks, in order to develop a strategy. We must keep these points in mind and remember that a serious strategy must be based on the real economy, on the small and medium-sized enterprise system, and naturally it must give a responsible role to workers, through their participation, too.
costep_2010-05-19_10_75	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too have an observation to make on what happened in the last decade, 2000-2010, as far as Lisbon is concerned. It is true that many of us, given also what happened until 2008-2009, viewed the results obtained with less than complete satisfaction. Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly the case that that decade gave rise to hopes and aspirations, and that much was done to achieve the objectives that had been set, particularly in the area of employment. Today, we find ourselves at the beginning of a new, more problematic, more difficult decade, and as regards the proposals that have been presented to us so far, I partly agree with them, although when reading them thoroughly, I still see too many shortcomings. I would dwell at length on what are the guiding principles of this proposal, but I shall limit myself to considering growth and employment. More jobs, more economic growth: this is the target that we must set ourselves, taking into account that we do so in a situation of excessive levels of public debt, of low structural growth, and of high rates of unemployment. Hence, the targets that we set ourselves are too ambitious and, at times, too inflexible. So, perhaps with a little less ambition and a little more flexibility, the growth and employment targets will be achievable.
costep_2000-04-12_12_7	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the diversity of languages is a source of cultural wealth. I thank the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, for having reinstated this aspect which was sorely lacking at the beginning, for having established from the outset that we are not simply facing a technical information and communication problem and for reminding us that the diversity of languages is the product of a civilisation which has both written and oral traditions. We must be wary of adopting a functional and utilitarian approach to languages, for this approach ignores the fact that language facilitates thought and that thought facilitates citizenship. I feel, therefore, that learning at least two languages is the minimum needed to keep up with the dynamic evolution of European democracy, as well as to ensure the mobility of students and workers. I just wonder what means are available to us now, apart from a few fine words and a tiny amount of money, to see this policy through. We must be able to think with our mother tongue and also with, or in, other languages. As a Frenchwoman I am convinced that being a French speaker goes hand in hand with using foreign languages. That is why we must convince parents, teachers and politicians that language learning must begin at primary school level, or even at pre-school level. That is also why interpreting and translating should not be relegated as they still are, to the status of ancillary skills. We must do more than simply argue in favour of the diversity of languages and call for differences to be respected. It is a question of whether Europe takes on an identity based on a range of identities, rather than just accepting a common ground of differences. This leads on to the debate on the official languages of the Community and the recognised languages, be they national or regional, of all of today’s countries and those of tomorrow, particularly in the context of enlargement, which, as we all know, is a cause for concern for us in terms of languages. Europeans also have a heritage, beginning with ancient Greek and Latin; we have all stressed this in committee and we must not lose these languages. Europeans must not neglect any language, nor must they forget the languages of the immigrants present in considerable numbers in our countries, or sign language which is the minority language par excellence. I feel that a successful awareness campaign must, of course, present languages as subjects to be studied and as a mechanism for exchang but it must also remind people that languages are also a source of fun and a pleasure.
costep_2010-11-10_14_25	Mr President, one of the fundamental principles of cooperation in the European Union is the freedom of movement of people. In its capacity as an entity recognised by international law, the reformed Union strives for the equal treatment of all citizens, which includes the freedom to travel throughout the world. In anticipation of the forthcoming European Union-US summit, it needs to be reiterated that out of 27 Member States, four, including Poland, are still subject to a restrictive visa regime. During the summit, the matter of the equal treatment of EU Member States in the visa waiver programme should be made a priority. This will be the first test of the effectiveness of the President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy. We will find out, too, if the talks with President Barack Obama are treated as the beginning of specific dialogue or if they prove to be a courtesy meeting on the occasion of the NATO summit which will be under way. Taking a strong line on the visa issue will show whether the US is treating the Union seriously as an entity recognised by international law.
costep_2001-02-13_5_2	Mr President, Commissioner, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has enabled us to take a great step towards the reconstruction of a Europe of the citizens; this is what Mr Méndez de Vigo likes to tell us; this is what we have heard on many occasions from Professor Rodríguez Bereijo, the representative named by the Head of the Spanish Government, Mr José María Aznar, for the convention drafting the Charter. And I believe that this is to the liking of the Europeans. To build, through this long process, a social Europe seems to me to be a great challenge and a great opportunity, which must be taken advantage of. But this construction is taking place at a specific moment, in particular economic, social and political circumstances. The Lisbon Summit decided to liberalise the telecommunications, gas, electricity and transport markets. We are experiencing a process of general globalisation and a change in the concept of industrial society and the labour market. We may ask ourselves: and what about the human factor? Both Nice and the social agenda agreed at that meeting highlight the need to count on the workers in management changes and combine the security and flexibility of economic growth with labour relations and the consequences for the social environment. And that is why, within the globalising dimension, we cannot ignore the importance of certain companies in certain regions and areas, for example the outlying regions, such as Galicia, where I come from myself, where they are the only or the main source of employment and where the threat of globalisation without guarantees would make families worried and nervous. Secondly, economic competitiveness and a healthy society must not be contradictory terms but rather harmonious ones. Thirdly, industrial restructuring, to use the expression in a broad sense, which is perhaps acceptable and inevitable from an economic point of view, cannot ignore the social consequences of that restructuring, which must be prepared for, since the objective of Community economic policies and measures must be to achieve a high level of employment. Fourthly and lastly, national Community aid, tax incentives etc. should be conditional upon long-term temporary binding commitments in the field of employment and local and regional development. These four points are only some of the considerations that the Commission and the Council must take into account in the face of the phenomenon of industrial restructuring. Of course, the participation of the works committees, the representatives of the workers, is expected. Mr President, globalisation reduces economic distances. We must commit ourselves to preventing it from increasing social differences.
costep_2009-10-07_16_100	As you are well aware, Romania is currently going through an unprecedented political crisis, on top of the economic and social crisis. Preparations are under way at the moment for a major electoral fraud. I am referring to the Romanian presidential elections which are due to take place on 22 November. All the elections in Romania have been rigged, but the scale of the fraud which is currently being planned is incredible. I am not accusing anyone in particular, but mechanisms have been created and honed for committing this type of fraud which are absolutely outrageous. They include false opinion polls, electoral tourism, additional lists, votes cancelled for actual voters and valid votes cast for dead people, huge sums of money and amounts of consumer goods used to bribe poor people, persuading parents by bribing schoolchildren, computer fraud and many other illegal acts. Please help save Romania. I am making an SOS appeal on behalf of the Romanian people. The institutions of the European Council, including primarily the European Parliament, have a moral duty to help a Member State remain civilised. Do not allow the Balkan mafia to wreck the European Union’s noble project. I am sounding this alarm bell because the European Union’s institutions are the Romanian people’s last hope.
costep_2010-02-10_10_200	While tax fraud must be combated, it must not make us forget that fraud alone would never have led to the economic crisis we are going through today. This crisis is a structural crisis of capitalism and originates in the very logic of that system, the virtues of which the European elites blindly extol. I am voting for this text because I condemn the pursuit of personal profit to the detriment of the common good. This logic is just as much a part of tax fraud as it is of European neoliberalism, which is much more responsible than fraud for the failure of the Millennium Development Goals, however timorous. VAT, which this text also supports, is one of the aberrations of this system. It is the most unjust tax in the world, as it subjects all citizens to the same rate of taxation in spite of the huge differences in income that are the mark of neoliberalism. It is a pity the text does not tackle the basic problem or attempt finally to put the fair distribution of the wealth produced for the common good on the European policy agenda.
costep_2002-11-20_3_308	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have been given the delicate task of presenting the report by Elisa Damião, who is ill and therefore cannot be here today, although she has been lucid and clear-minded enough to follow every step of this report which quite rightly, therefore, bears her name. I feel very moved to be presenting this report, I send my greetings to Mrs Damião and hope that she is able to return to Parliament as soon as possible, because she is a person of enormous political and parliamentary ability, as well as being a great citizen. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the amazing progress that has been made in biology and in molecular genetics is fascinating and disturbing at the same time. Scientific knowledge has moved ahead at such a pace that we are now in a position radically to change not only the vegetal and animal world, but also, eventually perhaps, our own species. This represents a genuine sea change. The abilities of science and technology have now largely gone beyond the fictions contained in literary masterpieces such as Huxley’s 'Brave New World' or George Orwell’s 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'. Nevertheless, if the truth be told, the visions contained in those works, of societies and human beings oppressed and dehumanised by the manipulation of science and technology, have fortunately not been fulfilled. The concern expressed by the broader public, however, with regard, for example, to genetically modified organisms and to cloning is a very clear sign, which the political, scientific and industrial world must heed. An initial response was drawn up by UNESCO when, in November 1997, by consensus it adopted the universal declaration on the human genome and human rights. However, of all the revolutions that have taken place in the realm of knowledge, that of molecular biology will, perhaps, be the greatest of all and it is genetics that will have the greatest implications in the economic, cultural and ethical spheres. Biotechnologies are part of the technologies of the future. The potential development of these gives us a glimpse of major changes in the coming years in the medicinal products, food, agriculture and environmental markets. Nevertheless, these technologies, in their practical applications, raise ethical and philosophical questions that are now part of today’s culture. Given their implications, there will always be pessimistic souls, as has always happened throughout history and throughout the history of science and technology, who see apocalyptic threats to humanity, awakening age-old fears and trepidation. We must combat those who exploit fears, ghosts and superstitions with a cautious but optimistic attitude towards science and realise that it must be inspired by high ethical standards and legal frameworks that, whilst encouraging intellectual freedom and scientific creativity, prevent excesses. The classical humanism expressed in the famous phrase of the philosopher Seneca stated that 'man is sacred to mankind'. This classical humanism must inspire contemporary science and all citizens. The European Union has availed itself in recent years of a panoply of directives and regulations in the field of biotechnologies and science. Nevertheless, the many legislative acts that have been adopted constitute a genuine rag-bag, lacking a coherent, global and systemic vision of this vast sector. Some legislation that has been adopted has not been implemented and other legislation has been subject to derogations, moratoria and, even worse, numerous voids and grey areas. The global battle in the field of biotechnologies is, nevertheless, crucial. The United States clearly lead the field in this area. Nevertheless, the Lisbon Summit outlined an ambitious target for the EU for the forthcoming decade: to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. How will this aim be achieved without a strong European commitment to biotechnologies? Europe is lagging behind the United States. Although the European Union has 1570 undertakings operating in this field and the United States has 1263, the fact is that these undertakings in the European Union employ 61 000 workers who produce a volume of business of EUR 42 billion, whereas in this same sector in the United States 162 000 workers are employed, producing the equivalent of EUR 365 billion. This is a summary, Mr President, of the cultural, political, legal and economic context into which the Commission communication fits. This is broadly supported by Mrs Damião’s report. In fact, the action plan and the strategy presented by the Commission resolve, with one wave of a magic wand, the diffuse nature, the incoherence and the shortcomings of the legal framework and of European policies in the field of biotechnologies. We will clearly not be able to achieve this with one wave of the wand, but they do point us in the right direction.
costep_2007-03-14_6_30	The EU stands to gain nothing from a rigid model for defining economic activities and for determining their public or private nature. The modern economy - and Europe’s in particular - needs flexibility. That being said, the best model for European integration is one that leaves room for each Member State to choose the paths that their citizens would like to follow and for the Member States themselves to be given room to make mistakes. The possibility of making mistakes is part and parcel of freedom of choice. I therefore accept that there needs to be a clear definition, in legal terms, of what is meant by services of general economic interest (SGEIs) and social services of general interest (SSGIs). Their correct identification is important so that when the EU adopts standards it does not impose or prohibit anything that does not fall within its scope. Accordingly, I am in favour of much of what the report before us contains. I also agree with the rapporteur that SSGIs should be given adequate funding. This is unquestionable even if we differ over the means of funding and even if each Member State has a different understanding of its duty towards its citizens.
costep_2002-01-17_5_47	As I have said on several occasions, Madam President, Fatuzzo rhymes with 'merluzzo', which is the Italian word for cod! How, then, could I not speak on the subject of cod and hake? Here, we are trying to save the cod and hake species from extinction, for marine pollution is reducing their numbers significantly year by year. Therefore, if I may make a suggestion, Madam President, after announcing that I voted for the motion and stressing that what this document says is right, could we not manage - at least where fish are concerned, seeing as it is difficult to do this with men - to clone cod and hake? In this way, we really would be able to resolve the problem of restocking our waters; we would have loads of cod and loads of hake and we could all enjoy this excellent fisheries product!
costep_2010-02-24_20_20	Regional disparities remain a challenge in the context of the European Union. For this reason, it is essential that cohesion policy continues to support the less developed regions. I therefore welcome the initiative for an EU strategy for the Baltic Sea Region and the ongoing initiative for the Danube region. I urge Parliament, for the same reasons, to give some careful consideration to the possibility of new strategies for other regions. In south-western Europe, for example, Macaronesia (the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and Cape Verde) faces various shared challenges, and so a strategy for this region would improve communication systems, preserve the environment, promote growth, scientific exchange, job creation and security, and facilitate the fight against illegal immigration. This would also be a development for Europe’s Atlantic frontier and would establish another bridge between Europe and Africa.
costep_1999-09-15_11_23	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is some unanimity in this Parliament in our attitudes - although not in the nuances - on the Timor question. As this is the case, I would just like to say a few words, as I was a member of the parliamentary delegation of observers who went to Timor. I must tell you that we did our duty, and added to this Parliament’s good name because we visited, I believe, more of the area than any other delegation (we went 200 kilometres to the East), and checked more polling stations than anyone else. It was useful for us to be able to bring you this news which we expected to describe in quite different terms when we left Timor and which was of interest to the Timorese, who, at least at that time, felt supported and who still are being supported. This referendum was an impressive sight, really quite impressive! An entire people - for nobody was to be seen in the streets - an entire people turned out to vote, expressing their national feeling, their bravery, their sense of democracy and their love of freedom. Anyone who prides himself or herself on being a defender of democracy would have found it inspiring to witness that scene. The Timorese created a flower, a castle of hope which, in one outburst of violence, was brought down and destroyed in blood, violence and death. Once again, it is not politicians but the Timorese themselves, with their cries and their pain who have drawn attention to their just cause. I think that this time, Timor will not be forgotten again and I think that the ever growing support for the long-suffering and heroic people of Timor will remain strong until they are free and until Timor is a happy nation - one that is moving forwards.
costep_1999-10-27_8_2	Mr President, the CULTURE 2000 programme, as a single instrument, will be replacing the ARIANE, KALEIDOSCOPE and RAPHAEL programmes which gave outstanding service to the cause of European culture and whose success has been universally acknowledged. Thanks to the activities that were developed within the respective frameworks, access to a vast range of cultural products and values has been provided for many European citizens who would not otherwise have had this opportunity. As a single financing and programming instrument for cooperation, CULTURE 2000 declares a range of objectives which aim to provide a response, more of a response and a better one, to such needs, and this, then, is able to represent a decisive step in the direction of a European cultural policy that is worthy of this name. By this I mean an instrument which will permit repeated, interactive and fruitful contact between the cultures of the various Member countries in such a way that the variety of areas looked at and the multidisciplinary nature of the events become an ever more vitalising element in the very soil of European identity without threatening pluralism and the essential diversity of these cultures. Although all the participants in the various phases of the process bore these concerns in mind, it became clear that the attitudes of the Council and the Commission on the one hand and of this Parliament on the other were not completely attuned with one another. But although we have come a long way, we should nevertheless mention some of the main areas of disagreement. These are, of course, the budgetary question, the question of a supposedly excessive fragmentation or disintegration of the Union’s actions, which is considered likely to reduce its visibility and, as a result, the question of an option in the sense of there being privileged lines which would support initiatives of a greater scale and of a more spectacular kind. The participation of agents and operators had been foreseen for this, which would involve a greater number of countries as a minimum which, as we see it, would carry a serious risk of hypertrophy in some networks of cultural operators. This would give them an excessive concentration of means and powers and, as a result, threaten the normal functioning and even the very existence of many others. Consistent with the Mouskouri report which this Parliament was right to adopt, the recommendation to which I am honoured to put my name, maintained its aim of seeing the budgetary appropriation strengthened, from the EUR 167 million initially provided, and raised it to 250 million. There is no doubt that both the Council and the Commission are sensitive to the great needs that are being experienced in all the sectors covered by the programme, nor that there is much good will in the sense of trying to find satisfactory solutions. Moving now to other points of disagreement, I will say that experience shows that the greater the number of States participating, the greater the risk of each initial project losing its own character. Now, in principle, each initial project corresponds to needs experienced specifically by a given group of citizens. On the other hand, it seems obvious that there are great imbalances as a result of extremely varied conditions of time, method and place, in terms of the opportunity for access to the enjoyment of cultural values that the citizens of various European countries possess. This aspect tends to become even more complex with the perspective of enlargement which has, to a large extent, been prepared and anticipated at exactly the level of cultural contacts. This is why the possibility was foreseen of supporting medium- and even small-scale actions so that the greatest possible number of European citizens benefit, who will, as a result, be able to become more directly involved. Visibility will not count for much unless it relates intimately to life and to what culture has to offer. In this respect, more concessions were made, and a minimum number of three was accepted for States involved in the joint organisation of specific projects and of five for States involved in the large-scale cultural cooperation agreements. Attempts were also made to find a way towards making the framework mechanisms more flexible. There was also the intention to stimulate the emergence of new synergies and of new thrusts for creativity without wanting to favour a sector-based approach to action. It is becoming a matter of urgency that we move ahead. There are countless cultural operators and agents who will be deprived of any kind of means for the action that they are developing, which will be of inestimable value if this dossier is not concluded before the end of the year so that we can allow the programme to come into force at the beginning of next year. The figures calculated for conciliation will make this possible, as we know, moreover, that this conciliation will be conducted in parallel with the conciliation relating to the YOUTH programme, although it will be completely autonomous in relation to this programme. We all know that our cultural coordinates are related to our sense of identity as Europeans. We also know that fundamental action linked to cultural life in its multiple forms is an indispensable factor for the strengthening of an awareness of European identity. Until this dimension is fully achieved, political union itself will have feet of clay. Culture on its own can be one of its strongest foundations. In order to achieve this, there will have to be greater participation on the part of the citizens, and greater access to culture. I shall close my speech with the hope that this Parliament’s actions will make an important contribution to achieving this.
costep_2000-03-17_3_3	Mr President, this is a very specific instrument which is of major importance for all citizens. However, it is the farmers who have to be its protagonists. Our position on the proposal for a regulation on information measures relating to the common agricultural policy can be summarised as follows: after the period of DG VI management and dependence on EAGGF-Guidance, a window of further transparency has at last been opened, and it must not be allowed to close. The common agricultural policy is an instrument for farmers: it is a basis from which to provide farmers with a broader understanding of their overall role, both in respect of the consumer and in terms of the major environmental issues. It is also the means of increasing awareness, among farmers, of current situations and, in particular, of the requirements of European society as a whole. All too often, we have heard speeches extolling the virtues of the CAP’s role in production, the environment and consumer and agricultural protection. On many occasions, these words proved to be an end unto themselves and did not provide specific occasions for taking up the opportunities offered. This regulation is our chance to send a clear message to the farming world. This is why we do not understand why the CAP should be extended to include all the consumer and environmental associations, which can claim no rights and have no responsibilities as regards measures of this type. Should we pass up this opportunity, we will miss another chance to target the objectives of growth, shared responsibility, multifunctionality and quality improvements, which are the basis of the European measures envisaged for the agricultural sector. We are also concerned at the poor level of funding available to implement the programme. This is all the more reason why the policy should not be broadened to include as many potential tenderers as possible, but rather, in the light of what has just been said regarding determining who represents agriculture, this extension must lead to the judicious, appropriate allocation of funding to the destination indicated in the very title of the programme, the common agricultural policy, where the term agricultural is a decidedly operative word. If we were to take a different path, we would only be contributing to highlighting the existence of a tangle of roles, which would be of no benefit to either farmers or consumers. On the other hand, this major programme is an opportunity for responsibilities to be defined and recognised, in order to provide the farming world with a genuine opportunity to take the lead in the changes taking place. However, in all this, we must not forget or overlook the merits of the other organisations which have taken up parallels with the world of agriculture production and interpreted them to best advantage, without mentioning the fact that this broadening out to embrace other activities in itself represents a development of areas of potential recognised by the Union. The transfer from EAGGF-Guidance to EAGGF-Guarantee is another consoling aspect, in terms of attaining the objectives already outlined, providing both the possibility of tracking funds to their destination and, in particular, to the objectives which we want to achieve. Alongside all this, in consolidation of the positions expressed, the true focus of the programme must not be forgotten: the involvement of the farmers themselves in adopting a more resolute stance on the validity of the instruments introduced under the reform of the common agricultural policy. Today, this instrument appears to be fully understood by most of the farming world, but not all. It is probably this element which is most attached to conventional schemes that are difficult to reconcile with the rapid, revolutionary changes which we are witnessing. But it is an element which the Union itself intends to adapt more closely to current conditions and manoeuvre towards the euro, globalisation and the open market, and also towards those market niches which are characteristic of economically sound areas which must be developed still further. In line with this rationale, a parallel with the development of rural tourism springs to mind. Rural tourism is a source of income and, at the same time, a means of protecting a citizen’s land. It is proposed as a driving force that will speed up the passage to a European agriculture which encompasses as wide a range of production possibilities and sources of income as possible. Rural tourism not only meshes well with organic production, but also complies with the highest of product quality standards recognised by the European Union. Factors such as these confirm the integration of agricultural policy with the other forms of economic and social development of the European Union.
costep_2011-05-11_13_43	Mr President, this debate has been useful. This is a very serious situation for those countries in crisis, but it is just as serious for Germany, Austria and Finland, because taxpayers in these countries have suffered budget cuts and been through serious crises. The questions have been justified, and that is why it is very important that the Portuguese issue should be made a model example of how a crisis can be held in check, dealt with, and prevented from spreading. I think that Portugal must now first ensure that it repays the loans by selling its assets, as has been said. It must also negotiate with its individual lenders to establish concrete proposals and ideas about how this crisis can be beaten. Voters in Germany, Austria and Finland will not stand for it if, for example, there should be new bailouts for Greece or if this case should fail.
costep_1997-04-08_2_27	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let us take an inclusive political view of this matter, rather than a divisive legal one. It is a question of the equality of freedom of all people as living beings. We breathe the same air, we drink the same water - as Antiphon the Sophist said, who first expressed the idea of equality of freedom. The thinkers of the Enlightenment revived this concept, and it was never applied merely to abstract legal entities or property-owners, but to real, physical, historical, social living beings. In other words, the distinctions that are being made here are artificial. They were invented subsequently. We need to develop a human and civil rights policy like the one which Etienne Balibar has set out repeatedly in his most recent publications. Let us all finally recognize the fact that human and civil rights policy represents a key element of Europe’s heritage that is essential to building a Europe which seeks to make its own specific, positive and constructive contribution to the development of human civilization!
costep_2005-05-09_1_102	Mr President, I would add my voice of congratulation to our rapporteur and, indeed, to the Commission on an ambitious report and package. I would stress the importance of such ambition from the European level for the European film industry. By way of example of how not to do it and why we need this package, look at Scotland. We have a high-quality film infrastructure, talented technicians and actors and stunning locations, yet we are not known for our film industry. With good reason: our government does not adequately support it. A film about Mary, Queen of Scots, is about to be made in Ireland; a new film version of Macbeth - the Scottish play - will be shot on the Isle of Man. Government support for film is crucial in the global market of the film industry. This report demonstrates why we need a European framework that is ambitious and has a soul to it that we can push forward from a European dimension. I congratulate the rapporteur and I shall be giving a copy of the report to the Scottish Government.
costep_2002-01-16_13_16	Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Myller, and also the shadow rapporteurs, especially our group’s own, for the work done on this report. I consider neither the Commission’s proposal nor the report presented by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to be worthless. I do not, therefore, quite understand the proposal by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the Greens that the proposal and the common position should be rejected in their entirety. Another reason why I do not understand it is that, if I understand rightly, the Member States' environment ministers are not exclusively Christian Democrats but, rather, primarily Greens and also liberal Social Democrats and members of our family of parties. To be sure, we often have to criticise and improve what the Council submits to us but, in view of this political constellation, it is somewhat problematic to say that it is all nonsense. Despite our criticisms, we have to improve on the Council’s proposal without completely rejecting it. In particular, I would call upon us to produce some stringent wording concerning subsidies that have harmful effects on the environment. The Council’s wording strikes me as too weak. I believe that, whenever it is said that the protection of the environment costs money, one has first to bear in mind that, of course, the destruction of the environment and its consequences cost money, and that it is even worse when the destruction of the environment is being subsidised - in other words, when money is being paid out for it. There are possibilities there for very effective savings. I therefore emphatically support the idea of reducing subsidies. The Committee has now decided on 2005 as a deadline. A lot of people have problems with that, and not only in our group. That is why there are various proposals for compromise. I believe, though, that we must, whatever happens, agree on an amendment that is more stringent than what the Council has decided on. We should also not put other economic instruments, such as a fiscal reform, to one side, but should follow them through at a European level.
costep_2000-07-05_4_72	It is a good thing that there is a desire to step up measures against money laundering, not just in relation to crime associated with drug trafficking, as in the previous directive, but also as regards money laundering linked with organised crime and a wider range of defined offences, that is to say fraud, corruption and other illegal activities damaging the Community’s financial interests. However, the proposal for a directive is not without its controversial aspects, particularly in so far as it undermines professional secrecy in certain sectors, notably the legal profession, whilst failing to impose a corresponding obligation to declare suspicious activities relating to high-value business transactions on professionals such as those selling luxury items, auctioneers, customs officials and so on. The rapporteur of this European Parliament report accordingly puts forward certain approaches which are slightly different to those contained in the proposal for a directive, but he basically supports it. In any case, one important and central issue, that is the growing liberalisation of financial markets and movements of capital, is not addressed, which means that the practical effects of this liberalisation will continue to be weakened. That is why I am abstaining.
costep_2007-07-10_10_47	The Union for the Presidential Majority (UMP) delegation wishes to point out and highlight the fact that ownership unbundling is not the best answer to current market dysfunctions. In a context of strong competition, which sees the emergence of powerful non-European operators, we feel it is dangerous to dismantle the European energy companies in the name of a dogmatic approach to competition policy, far removed from the industrial strategies that ought to strengthen the European Union in global competition. European energy supply is a strategic long-term issue that requires its security to be guaranteed beyond the duration of a single contract. This security of energy supply depends upon investments that are already clearly inadequate. They will, however, have to increase significantly in order to meet our future needs whether for gas or electricity. Ownership unbundling means that our traditional energy operators will not be able to realise these investments in the energy networks. Handing over this opportunity to new entrants, who will not necessarily have the financial resources needed, or to non-European companies, who do not necessarily share our assessment of our future needs is very dangerous and very worrying. In these circumstances, the UMP delegation expects the European Commission to develop an alternative approach to ownership unbundling.
costep_2006-11-15_3_57	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if Europe is to support growth and employment, it needs to expand the market and eliminate the excessive bureaucratic red tape that exists in this sector. However, this must not prejudice workers' rights or lead to exploitation or social dumping. Despite the fact that, after a hard-fought parliamentary battle, a series of socially important services have been excluded from the original directive, the text on which we are about to vote remains ambiguous and still does not clearly set the boundary between this directive and labour law and national social safeguards. Despite this morning’s reassurances, it is for these reasons that we call for the directive, when it is actually implemented, to respect national conciliation practices and not to bypass sector-wide collective agreements. Above all, we call for the application of the directive to be strictly monitored, so that the rules protecting employee and consumer rights and health and safety at work are not breached.
costep_2010-05-18_9_142	I endorsed the EU strategy for youth with complete conviction and with certainty as to its success. It is one of the key areas of the work of the Committee on Culture and Education, on which I serve. It is imperative to improve the situation of young people and their educational and vocational chances. Three matters are crucial in this regard. 1. Young people in the EU, and also in Poland, are making good use of EU programmes, such as Comenius, Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci. Therefore, it is very important to increase funding for these programmes and to recognise them as the basis for development of a multiannual EU strategy for youth. In the future, these programmes should receive greater financial support. Investment in the education of young people is the best possible use of the EU budget. I also appeal for improvement and full implementation of the Erasmus Mundus programme. 2. As a socialist, I also stress the need to create equal opportunities for young people in their access to education. It is essential to give financial assistance to those who cannot afford to complete tertiary education. It is also important to help young people by making their access to the labour market easier. 3. In view of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, I would like to draw attention to the obligations of Member States concerning implementation of the strategy, which includes encouraging young people to participate in democratic life, paying special attention to young sportsmen and sportswomen and the legal enforcement of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
costep_2004-03-11_1_25	Mr President, I too wish to join with the previous speakers in expressing my deepest sympathy with the people of Spain, the victims, and their families. Difficult though it is to pass on to the agenda, our topic is ‘health care and care for the elderly’, and it is a very important one. In all probability, this report will receive very broad support in the House today - the result of excellent cooperation between Members belonging to all the political groupings, for which I would like to extend the warmest of thanks to all of them, but especially to Mr Mantovani. I might add that my report follows on from his own, which he presented a year ago, and the things we called for then are every bit as relevant today as they were at the time; indeed, the problems have become even more pressing. Let me only cite the length of time people have to wait for treatment, the worsening staffing bottlenecks and the alarming reports of conditions in care homes, some of which are degrading. Governments, too, have now realised how important it actually is to organise a structured exchange of information both in the health sector and in the sphere of care for the elderly. Whilst the results of the high-level reflection process speak for themselves, we now have no more time to lose, and so we strongly urge the European Council to adopt at last the principle of application of the open coordination method and a detailed timetable. The common objectives and indicators should be agreed by early 2006. After all, the Convention did, in its draft treaty, specify open coordination for health policy - with, of course, this House participating as it should. If the Member States want to guarantee the future accessibility, quality and financial viability of health systems and care for the elderly, then what is needed most of all is more prevention and transparency. At both European and national levels, prevention and health promotion must receive the same attention as curative medicine. If they do not, we really will soon be unable to cope with the growing burden of patients. Transparency, though, is an indispensable requirement if quality is to be maintained and if the best possible use is to be made of the resources that health systems possess. Far more than has formerly been the case, the quality of medical services must be demonstrable. We must no longer spend a lot of money and get poor quality in return. Patients’ organisations have a very important part to play in this, and must, in future, be more involved in all decisions on matters of health policy. All Member States should also adopt a patients’ law or patients’ charter, but, in order to secure greater legal security for people who become ill and have to be treated abroad, we also need common European standards for patients’ rights. It would indeed be a major breakthrough if a European patients’ charter were to be adopted, and so we urge the Commission and the Member States to devise shared criteria for one. A large number of questions, though, still remain open after the European Court of Justice’s rulings on the reimbursement of treatment costs incurred in another Member State, and so what we expect from the Commission is proposals, not only as to how patients can have greater legal certainty, but also as to how the national health services can be protected from the potentially adverse effects of the internal market rules. The effects of European rules should be monitored by a standing committee of experts, which would submit reports on a regular basis. The fact is that health is not an economic commodity; our health services are founded on solidarity, and that must be defended. All the Member States also face major challenges as regards long-term care and care for the elderly. We should join together in seeking strategies for integrating health provision and care more effectively with each other, for better care at home and for the provision of sufficient care homes. There is also a need for clear standards of care, not only in people’s own homes but also in institutions, and, above all, for regular and independent quality controls. There is, then, much to be done if our European model of a health policy founded upon solidarity is to be maintained in the long term.
costep_2010-01-20_7_12	The European Ombudsman acts in order to tackle cases of poor administration by Community institutions and bodies, either on his own initiative, or by following up a complaint. This means that the European Ombudsman is helping to construct a Europe of Citizens just as the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has become legally binding. It should be noted that the right to good administration is a fundamental right for European citizens, enshrined in Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In 2001, the European Parliament approved a resolution on the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, which must be respected by the institutions and bodies of the European Union. I would argue that this code should become a European law, which would have legislative coherence in the EU and would be a guarantee that those very basic principles would be adhered to by its institutions when dealing with citizens. It is crucial that European citizens know their rights and how they can go about protecting them and recovering them if they are violated.
costep_1998-01-13_4_29	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, the debate on transatlantic relations always contains elements of great political interest. As has been shown this evening, giving transatlantic relations a political, economic and commercial framework which will allow the development of cooperation in as many areas as possible needs to be one of our objectives for the near future. Nevertheless it is worth remembering, firstly, that the European Union is the foremost commercial power in the world. Secondly, the establishment of the euro should be a stimulus to negotiations on the New Transatlantic Agenda. Thirdly, against a background of globalization - which will particularly favour the most competitive economies - the European Union cannot forget its obligations to those countries which face difficulties. Nor can it alter its traditional system of bilateral negotiation, cut its cooperation budgets, or shield itself, as the United States does, either as a means of external reprisal or as the result of hypothetical internal pressures. We all recognize the important role the United States has played in the defence of democracy. However, that does not mean that their concept of democracy has always been the same as ours. Their legitimate eagerness to help people gain their freedom has sometimes resulted in unusual laws, claiming national security or external threats as a sacrosanct excuse, and leading (in the case of Cuba for example) to bilateral relations being placed in a delicate situation. We have to realize that the European Union has a certain disadvantage compared with the United States when it comes to making decisions in exceptional situations. It is difficult to implement trade defence mechanisms in response to external pressures, as we have found, but it is not impossible. As the European Union becomes more widely seen as a political entity, our negotiating position in the international institutions will become stronger. This will be particularly important in the case of the World Trade Organization, which is the body to which all disputes should be referred, instead of trying to resolve them through the back door, with the Europeans always giving in for the sake of pax americana . The European Union cannot give up and cease to play its rightful role as the world’s most important commercial power. We should include other - possibly unpleasant - questions in the agenda, such as environmental or social matters. Finally, I want to congratulate Mrs Mann for her magnificent piece of work. And I should like to remind the Commission that, on our part, the New Transatlantic Agenda should also take account of the development of the whole American continent, to which we are bound by a wide range of agreements, of varying importance, which will facilitate the great Atlantic market. The United States is also interested in this, and wants to stimulate it. What can never be included in this agenda, but has sometimes been suggested, is the supposed distribution of political power, in the form of zones of influence, so that South and Central America becomes yet another area under the clear influence of the United States.
costep_1998-06-17_17_7	Mr President, I notice that the previous speaker has learnt to read, but has not learnt to stop reading. We have only recently had proof of how Pakistan and India, through smuggling, fraud, theft and bribery have obtained the means to manufacture a nuclear bomb. I do not claim that a nuclear power plant is an atomic bomb, but the nuclear power lobby in Europe engages in that same secrecy and lying in public that has characterized the behaviour of states with newly-acquired nuclear arsenals. I would hope that the citizens of Europe can trust those who use nuclear power plants to the extent that nuclear power poses no danger to them. The main problem is that nuclear plants produce spent fuel. That is the end product, and there is nowhere to dump it. For that reason, it has to be transported to and fro, and it is quite possible that all Europe’s nuclear waste has now ended up being dumped in the wrong place and that it will all have to be moved yet again. That is why urgent measures are required of the Commission to enable the gradual construction of final nuclear waste sites.
costep_2008-04-10_12_64	While expressing our sympathy for the victims, our desire that the conflicts should be peacefully resolved and our principles of the defence of democracy, human rights and international law, we feel that once again a resolution on the situation in Tibet contains elements that do not strictly correspond to the situation as it is actually developing. It is increasingly evident that what is actually in hand is an operation against the Beijing Olympic Games; this is the real motivation behind the escalation in provocation and much of the hypocritical indignation expressed. Once again, arguments are being manipulated to justify current and future interference and infringements of international law, with attempts to impose strategic and economic interests against China. It is significant that we are still talking about Tibet as a territory occupied by China when the powers instigating and supporting the separatist movements which are at the root of the violent actions are not challenging the integrity of the territory of the People’s Republic of China, including Tibet as an Autonomous Region. Finally, what morals can this House have in adopting such a resolution when, less than a month ago, it adopted a report on Iraq without a single mention of the aggression and occupation by the US?
costep_2002-06-13_4_101	The Brok report urges Member States and candidate countries to make the effort required to conclude the accession negotiations at the end of this year so that the accession treaties might be signed in about April 2003 with a view to ten new countries' joining in 2004. We heartily approve of such a move. At the Berlin Council in 1999, six candidate countries had in fact been expected to join the EU in 2002. Well, here we are in 2002, and no country has joined. We cannot continue like this. As I shall state in my explanation of vote on the Böge report, we have to break down the last barriers while retaining a sense of what is realistic. In any case, there is at least one problem that is not really a problem: the non-ratification of the Treaty of Nice by the Irish people. If, by chance they were again to reject this faulty treaty in a second referendum (despite the blandishments of the Seville Council, with its teasing declaration of respect for Irish military neutrality), enlargement would not be compromised for all that. It would be enough to include the relevant parts of the Treaty of Nice in the future accession treaty. Moreover, the opportunity could be taken to revise them, which would be no bad thing.
costep_2011-06-08_5_24	Mr President, the crisis compels us to review both national and European Union budgets from the aspect of efficiency and to see how they serve our goals, and how much added value, European added value, they bring to this effect. I would like to talk about a field that has not been mentioned so far today, namely, cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs, which was elevated from the competence of Member States to EU policy level by the Treaty of Lisbon. Our desire to achieve great improvement in this field must be reflected in the subsequent budget period. We definitely have to provide funds for the Stockholm programme, which is a rather ambitious programme. Europe is in need of well-educated immigrants who reach Europe in compliance with the regulations, and of a common migration policy with adequate resources. The events in North Africa have drawn attention once again to the importance of a common European immigration policy, and have shown the need for integration supported by resources and for European solidarity. The last few months have also highlighted the fact that protection of our common values, non-discrimination and human rights also need protection and resources, that we need to simplify the use of resources for the management of extraordinary situations, and that we need our own resources to create a better, stronger and more extensive Europe in the coming period.
costep_2010-06-15_8_182	It is an indisputable fact that the Internet now has a public role, influencing not only daily life but also mass movements, political ideas and communication strategies. It is true to say that the Internet has taken on an irreplaceable public role, and this cannot be ignored by the Member States of the European Union. They should call for greater access and participation in the governance of the Internet without undermining the leading role of private use and daily management of the network in doing so, as this has proved essential for the vitality and growth of the Internet. The role of the Member States are becoming more important, as are issues relating to cybercrime and protecting the security of users and their privacy, along with the public’s freedom of access and expression through the Internet.
costep_1999-03-09_6_13	The Europe of Nations Group naturally recognises the specific features of arctic agriculture and the significance of the fact that more than 30 different ecosystems have been identified across the Member States of the European Union. As the CAP’s name indicates, it is a common policy. That is why the Europe of Nations Group opposes paragraphs 3 and 7 of the rapporteur’s resolution. In fact, a specific regional agricultural policy for the agriculture of the arctic regions is being proposed. While it might be possible for us to consider incorporating specific products, such as reindeer, into an existing COM, for example the COM in beef, we should not use the excuse of a specific ecosystem to replace a common agricultural policy with 30 specific agricultural policies. The regional aspects of the CAP must be recognised in both rural development policy and regional policy. I would emphasise that the sub-arctic regions are currently part of Objective 6 and have been incorporated into the new Objective 1 under Agenda 2000. So these regions benefit now, and will continue to benefit in the future, from specific and significant support to compensate for the higher costs inherent in the ecosystem. I would remind you that, in the context of regional policy for this region, Community subsidies amount to 75 % of the total cost of structural investment. Consequently, as paragraphs 3 and 7 were adopted, our group voted against the resolution in the final vote. After the drive by some people to 'break' the CAP by incorporating the principle of cofinancing, a principle which is contrary to the Treaty and the specific status of compulsory expenditure, others are now hoping to damage the CAP by trying to regionalise it on the basis of specific ecosystems. Members of our group are attached to the CAP which has been one of the fundamental bases of the construction of Europe as enshrined in the Treaty of Rome. It is surprising that those who defend an integrated and federal Europe should be destroying the only genuine common policy apart from the common fisheries policy. Katiforis report A4-0090/99
costep_2002-03-14_4_73	The proposed directive establishes prudential rules (capital adequacy requirements and supplementary supervision) with regard to financial conglomerates. We believe the aim is the socialisation of these sectors (credit, insurance and investment) because the purpose of these rules, in our view, stems from a public service approach. In a rational economy, funding should be granted according to social need for investment, and insurance should be integrated into social funds for investment and social protection. This directive is a feeble attempt to regulate the financial markets, the chaotic workings of which are now seen to be the cause of financial crises and social catastrophes throughout the world, as the Enron affair has illustrated. I voted in favour of the directive without any illusions, if only to curb the ambient ultra-liberalism and because we are not in favour of making things worse in order to further our own ends, which would amount to waiting for faults in capitalism to result in a final crisis. Social campaigning alone will put a stop to the erring ways of an uncontrollable system.
costep_2008-04-24_8_2	Madam President, the Commission’s priorities for 2009 are increased employment, climate change and a sustainable Europe. Employment in the European Union is especially deserving of attention. The Amsterdam Treaty was adopted in November 1997 during the Luxembourg summit. This created the basis for the formation of a European employment strategy. Due to the problem of unemployment in the Member States, where 17 million people were out of work at that time, this issue was made a priority. Nine years later, in 2006, in the enlarged European Union, 64.3% of people of working age were in employment. Denmark had the highest level of employment, Poland the lowest. A total of 7.9% of people of working age were unemployed. As a comparison, unemployment in the United States was 4.6%. Over the last year, 24 of the Member States recorded a drop in unemployment and three reported an increase. The largest decreases were seen in Poland, Bulgaria and Latvia and the largest increase in unemployment was in Estonia. The report by Mrs Haug shows just how important is the role played by the Member States in the European Union’s employment policy.
costep_2011-03-10_3_7	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rescue packages were intended to protect EU Member States from insolvency. However, they are overwhelming citizens with brutal austerity programmes and allowing the perpetrators to get off scot-free. On top of that, the Commission is now interfering in national wage policy, too. Mr Hahn, it is quite absurd and it brings tears to my eyes when I hear formal arguments like yours that this is not at all intended to be a socio-political measure. Such a position is utterly unacceptable. Wage policy is not the business of the EU. This policy on the part of the Commission is at complete odds with the idea of this European Union. The EU was never intended to be about competition in wages and social dumping. This Commission policy talks about the inflexibility of wages, which is to be reduced. It states that wages should reflect market conditions. This is like a blind man describing an elephant. People who write such things have no understanding of collective agreement systems. They interfere in free collective bargaining and reduce the much talked-about autonomy of the social partners and the social dialogue to absurdity. I would like to make it clear that this Parliament is called on to ensure that the autonomous collective agreement policy is retained, to protect the social dialogue and to prevent the further dismantling of social security. We need measures to prevent a counterproductive austerity policy, not punitive measures.
costep_1997-02-19_8_1	Mr President, my reference to the regulations is based on Articles 127, 122 and 43. Even if the radical Alliance group tried, by its amendments, to improve the compromise, we remain critical of a procedure which we feel is a renouncement of the European Parliament in an exceptionally grave affair. We therefore have a basic disagreement, but my reference concerns the question of procedure which has led to the vote which will be held. On Monday, Mrs Barthet-Mayer and Mr Puerta stressed the very strong reasons for postponing this vote to after that on the motion of censure. Parliament decided otherwise and did not follow this demonstration, which was nevertheless very strong and based on considerable Parliamentary evidence. I will therefore not return to the matter.
costep_2009-11-12_11_47	I believe that citizens, companies, non-governmental organisations and any other agencies must be informed as fully as possible about the role and functions of the European Ombudsman, as this may also help reduce the number of complaints submitted which do not come under this institution’s remit. The knowledge that citizens have about what the Ombudsman does is generally limited. The launch of the new website at the start of 2009 is a welcome measure. However, I think that efforts to provide citizens with the best possible information must be stepped up. I therefore welcome the proposal made by the rapporteur about drafting an interactive guide, allowing citizens to find out as much information as possible about how to go about submitting a complaint, as well as about easily identifying the right way to resolve the problems they are facing.
costep_2010-05-18_13_48	When we talk about accession of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, we are talking about work which has been going on for 10 years now and about many fears concerning, inter alia, competition between the Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights. This will certainly lead to problems in the area of jurisdiction and the autonomy of the Court of Justice. I think, however, that what we have achieved after those 10 years can mean complementarity of the two systems, so perhaps we should depart from such hierarchical thinking. The Court of Justice has, for a long time, been following the work of the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and vice versa. Both these systems coexist and there is no competition between them, so perhaps those fears are unjustified. We need accession to the convention for symbolic reasons but, above all, we need the convention because it will complement the system of protection of human rights in the European Union and will give it greater credibility in the eyes of its citizens, for they will gain protection against the European Union and its institutions, and not only against the Member States, as has been the case until now. So we should be glad that the system will be strengthened. However, we do need a certain loyalty, so that we do not undermine the credibility of the system. This is why we propose that Member States do not prosecute each other on matters of EU law by using the possibilities afforded by the convention.
costep_2004-09-16_1_10	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is quite simply in my capacity as a European woman that I would like to speak today on the issue of ‘Women on Waves’. Like the Socialist Group in the European Parliament (PSE Group), I wonder whether the Portuguese Government’s decision to prevent the Dutch ship from entering its territorial waters was a breach of international law. I also, however, view it as a ban on the provision of care to fellow European women. Although in my opinion the ‘Women on Waves’ campaign is conducted in a somewhat provocative manner, I still believe that it is fundamentally legitimate. The association’s campaign is concerned with two women’s rights which to my mind are indispensable: the right to health and the right to dignity, both of which are included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In many Member States these rights have been defended for decades by women who fight to win governments over to their legitimate cause. This is also why I personally am shocked to find out that even today and within the European Parliament there is a movement of women trying to question the gains won over a long struggle. I am not here to reprimand those Member States which have chosen to restrict, prohibit or punish the practice of abortion, but I believe that the event of which I am speaking today should be an opportunity for these Member States to reopen the debate on this difficult issue. Women often have to take the serious decision to end a pregnancy on their own, and it is always a time of great distress. It is a choice which is never made casually, but in all conscience, and accusations of guilt or even criminal guilt are not the right response. Only dialogue and information will make it possible to move public opinion forward. Incidentally, repression is a godsend to illicit businesses which exploit ignorance and social weakness. This type of network should have no place in our Europe of freedoms. It is the duty of the European institutions to set an example in this field and to ensure that individual freedoms are respected. If the Commission fails to take a clear stance, it will be seen not just as a social injustice for these women, but as an unacceptable setback for their fundamental rights. I would like to add that the problem does not affect women alone. I find it a pity that there are so few men in our Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, and I would like to express my sincere thanks to those who have realised that we must unite to defend our ideas and to demonstrate our commitment. Our duty as Europeans is to use our judgment and compassion to help the women of our Member States confront their problems. This is why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE/ADLE Group) calls on the Council and the Commission to adopt a clear and democratic position.
costep_1997-06-11_10_2	Mr President, I think that we should begin by thanking Mrs Colombo for her work, which complemented that done by us in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and expressing our thanks also to members of that committee - Waddington, Wolf and Schörling - who tabled amendments. These amendments definitely enriched this report and simply seemed very important to me. One of them referred to the effect of public spending cuts on aspects such as health and education, where female employment rates are very high, and the fact that those cuts can harm women’s job chances. Certain amendments provided for Code measures to be taken not only in favour of a group but all workers, i.e. all female workers, who often have so-called 'rubbish' contracts or work part-time. Susan Waddington’s amendment is also important - it analyses the effect of the Code and looks at whether it might not be more effective to turn it into a legal instrument within three years. To sum up, the Code is addressed to the social partners, governments and associations. It also sets down guidelines for analysing pay structures and assessing jobs and, as a prior step, the compilation of adequate information on pay systems - which differ from country to country - and the study of collective bargaining procedures, to determine where action must be taken to avoid wage discrimination. Twenty years after the 1975 Directive was adopted, it can be noted - as Mrs Colombo does and the European Union’s own statistics bear out - that there is still a 20-30 % wage differential between women and men doing work of the same value. According to other statistics, only 20 % of contracts deal with the problem of inequality between women and men. We still have a long way to go. I must say that I am slightly sceptical about voluntary agreements, because if we cannot apply compulsory legislation I do not see how we can be expected to comply with voluntary agreements, such as the Code of Conduct between employers and the various social partners. However, given that there are still salary differences and that legislation has been unable to reduce them, it seems that any measure that we can take might be of use. One formula that might be useful would be first of all to encourage training and information for women so that they can accede to collective bargaining. Secondly, to foster the presence of women in company committees. At present it is men who discuss women’s problems and defend their rights but it is really up to women to defend their own rights. The current precariousness of employment - as is stated in one of the amendments - and public spending cuts do nothing to help the situation. We believe that the public sector would probably give a good example to private initiative if it adopted measures to continue to reduce pay differentials. We think that transparency is needed not only for assessing jobs but also for collective bargaining. We must raise awareness of social partners and inform them, and disseminate the Code, not only in large companies, not only among the social partners, not only among governments, but also among the SMEs which create more than 85 % of jobs in the European Union. I should also add that women’s associations should be informed. We rapporteurs shall do our best to make sure that women’s associations hear about the Code so that they can use it as an instrument to defend their rights. We should also consider extending Article 119 now that the IGC is coming to a close. If that article were to be extended, equal pay for work of equal value would then be enshrined in the new Treaty.
costep_2001-09-20_9_37	We voted in favour of this report because we consider that it deals properly with the serious problem of bullying and sexual harassment at the workplace. As indicated in the report, according to a survey of 21 500 workers in the European Union carried out by the Dublin Foundation, 8% state that over the last 12 months they have been subject to bullying at work, which if extrapolated to the total workforce means that over 12 million workers are probably victims of this kind of situation throughout the 15 Member States. As the report warns us, although the true scale of this phenomenon is unknown, it is a serious problem in working life, and it is equally certain that the general increase in short-term contracts and insecurity of employment, especially among women, is creating conditions that encourage the practice of various forms of harassment. We therefore support the measures proposed in the report for combating this phenomenon, including those for preventing it, those for increasing knowledge about it, exchanges of positive experience and the publication of a Green Paper by no later than March 2002, followed by an action programme of measures at Community level against bullying at work.
costep_2011-01-17_18_23	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I signed the oral question tabled by Mrs Angelilli because I think that the European Union cannot but make the protection of children one of its priorities, particularly in the light of the Treaty of Lisbon. In my opinion, adoption procedures are only the litmus test of a social issue that we are duty bound to tackle and impose some boundaries upon. In the best cases, the children become objects of commercial exchanges that certainly offend our dignity, but unfortunately, they are often also victims of exploitation and violence. Beyond the phenomenon of so-called ghost children - meaning those born illegally or abandoned and never picked up by the system - there is an undetermined number of children who can be adopted and who are matched by an equal number of couples hoping to adopt, who never cross paths due to legislative interpretation and cumbersome bureaucracy. The United Nations Children’s Fund recently published a study containing some alarming figures, including with regard to many European countries. As Chair of the Committee on Petitions, I have often run up against legal conflicts between Member States which result in negative or even tragic consequences for the children alone. The complex procedures involved in many national systems do not always turn out to be beneficial for the child. The long timeframes involved are at odds with the need to have the child placed within the first year of his or her life to reduce the trauma of the upheaval and to avoid long stays in orphanages, and also because we should consider that above a certain age, there is lower market demand, unfortunately. In the light of these figures, I believe that the green light should be given to the long-heralded need for Europe-wide coordination of national laws which, firstly, will help simplify inter-European adoption procedures and, secondly, will guarantee that the fundamental principles of adoption are observed when children are adopted from third countries.
costep_2001-11-28_7_8	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, the Prodi Commission’s existing policy on fighting fraud can really only be described as hesitant and dilatory when it comes to the really crucial questions. And I have very little hope that this will change, especially in the matter of the European Financial Public Prosecutor. A Green Paper is all the Commission has planned for the remaining years of its term of office. Your much-vaunted Commission reform programme lacks the crucial safety net. Those who abuse their freedoms must be capable of being brought to account. Your first duty ought to have been to clear up the old cases and call those responsible to account. Instead, you are hiding behind a hesitant judiciary in Belgium and Luxembourg. To prevent this sad truth from becoming so evident, you are following a policy of concealing information from Parliament, which you now want to get expressly embodied in the Financial Regulation. You are claiming for yourself the right to decide whether informing Parliament about a procedure is in the European Union’s interest or not. I would like to have seen you when you were a member of the State Parliament in Berlin, Mrs Schreyer, if the Governing Mayor had told you it was not in the city’s interest to inform you about certain things. That is precisely how you are presuming to treat the European Parliament today and you clearly fail to appreciate that in so doing you weaken not only this Parliament but, ultimately, also the Commission of which you are part.
costep_2008-02-18_21_4	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the transparency initiative is probably the greatest success achieved by the Barroso Commission. I am grateful to you, Commissioner, for your words and for the fact that you want harmonisation of the publication of information on beneficiaries of subsidies. This was a major point of discussion between Parliament and the Commission last year. As you know, this House and the PPE-DE Group have always stood by you on the issue of transparency because we want to know whether we are meeting our political objectives via the beneficiaries of the subsidies, in other words, the recipients of the funding. This is about meeting our political objectives, nothing else, and we need to know more than we do at present. Commissioner, you are working on new ethical rules. We believe that the institutions need these rules and the Commissioners themselves need a new code of conduct. However, in order to avoid misunderstandings, may I remind you that it is not up to the Commission to lay down rules for Parliament. We make our rules ourselves. We are not public officials, unlike the members of other EU institutions, although imprecise use of language could create this impression. We have an amendment to paragraph 22, and I would like to ask you very warmly for your support. We want to replace the list with a reference to the existing rules. Lists are all very well, but we want an open form of words which allows us to decide whether we want so many, or perhaps more - or, indeed, fewer - criteria. We are not satisfied - and this is part of the report - with the difficult question of the recovery of funds which have been paid out incorrectly. Commissioner, I think this is going to be the major issue for us this year and the main point of conflict between Parliament and the Commission. This is an area which is anything but transparent. I would ask you to tackle this problem vigorously. Recoveries cannot continue in the same random fashion as in the past. We welcome this week’s action plan for the Structural Funds, but this needs to be underpinned with credibility, both for Parliament and for the discharge of the Commission. Our rapporteur, Javier Pomés Ruiz, has drafted a good and interesting report, and I am sure that with this report as the opinion of Parliament, we will help the Commission to make further progress.
costep_2010-10-18_13_48	Today, it really is very important to reconcile work and family life better by striving for economic growth, welfare and competitiveness in the field of gender equality. As there is a steep decline in the birth rate in almost all Member States, we must take measures to create the best possible conditions for mothers to bring up children and to have a genuine opportunity to return to the labour market. I also call on the Member States and MEPs to find opportunities and coordinate the cost of maternity pay and childcare allowance in order to ensure that women are not a more costly work force than men. The sharing of family responsibilities and the opportunity to also grant men the right to two weeks paternity leave would give women increased opportunities to return to the labour market and would strengthen family relationships. Therefore, I am convinced that an extended period of maternity leave would also facilitate the achievement of improved birth rates, in particular, given that our society is ageing rapidly.
costep_2007-04-25_19_12	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by agreeing with Mr Díaz de Mera and Mr Castiglione, both from my group, in their praise for the rapporteur Mr Deprez, who has provided us with a characteristically excellent report. Mr Deprez made strenuous efforts to reach a compromise between all of the political groups and the Council, with a view to obtaining agreement at first reading. This is a most welcome initiative at a time when Europe is enduring the most significant migratory crisis in its history. The massive influx of illegal immigrants to European shores has made it imperative for us to adopt measures as a matter of urgency. Although the regions most directly affected are those of southern Europe, this problem cannot be viewed as exclusive to those Member States and regions. Irregular mass immigration and the humanitarian tragedy that it represents have consequences for security and cohesion throughout the European Community. I applaud the various operational measures relating to the management of our external maritime borders to the south, such as the establishment of an operational control centre to coordinate a patrol network for the Mediterranean coastline and the setting up of a central register of available technical equipment for use in control and monitoring of the external borders, whereby the necessary resources - for example boats, helicopters and aeroplanes - will be supplied for use in joint operations. I also warmly welcome the creation of rapid border intervention teams, which will offer rapid technical and operational assistance to those Member States that may require it. This will be a way of enhancing solidarity and mutual assistance between Member States. This regulation concerns the deployment of rapid border intervention teams in order to provide rapid assistance in the event of a repetition of previous situations, for example in the Canary Islands. I agree that assistance must be provided for a limited period, in exceptional situations or emergencies, and following a request by the Member State concerned. Mr President, the European agency Frontex should play a crucial role in coordinating this assistance, which it should do promptly and effectively. Within five days, a decision is made, and a plan drawn up, specifying the duration, geographical location, the mission to be undertaken, the composition, number and profile of experts that each Member State is to supply to the team. All of us - in Parliament, the Commission and the Council - have to deliver the necessary human and financial resources at institutional level for the mission to proceed effectively.
costep_2011-05-12_13_349	Unfortunately, a coherent, coordinated strategy on the role of culture in the EU’s external actions does not currently exist. As is well known, our interests can be best served when we speak with one voice. Our common foreign policy must be based on cultural diplomacy as Europe’s position in the world can be strengthened through culture, as an integral part of its economic, development and security policies. We will provide a better understanding of our continent by means of distributing films, music and literature. Furthermore, the EU’s diverse cultural landscape gives us the distinction of being the most attractive tourist destination in the world. I welcome the concrete suggestions presented in this report for the involvement of civil society, artists, educators, students and entrepreneurs in shaping the content of external cultural relations. At the same time, we absolutely need to take into account the huge potential offered by new technologies, which are both a source of information and a channel facilitating the freedom of expression. I think that it would be useful for the European Parliament to include culture on the agenda of discussions with other parliaments in the world, in order to help establish a general practice for European external action.
costep_2003-01-15_3_88	Fundamental rights are at the heart of our political commitment: we therefore were unable to vote for this report. Last year, Parliament adopted a method comprising the adoption of the Charter, the establishment of means, including the network of experts, and a joint effort by three rapporteurs, in order to achieve a consensus. This method has not been followed and this report, furthermore, reflects the opinion of the rapporteur rather than an in-depth analysis: the whole Charter and nothing but the Charter, and therefore an article-by-article, State-by-State analysis. This was an opportunity for Parliament to gain control over the Member States. Nothing but the Charter, in other words, the articles as they are and not as one might like them to be. This report will not affect the Charter at all, since only a new Convention has the power to change its articles. I regret that the recommendations made in the report go beyond the Charter, and can only lament the fact that the search for a consensus has perversely been replaced by the provocative and exaggerated nature of certain proposals. Moreover, it is completely pointless to overstate the situation. This report could have been awaited by the press and feared by the Member States. Having failed to achieve a unanimous vote, however, it will be buried alongside other pointless reports.
costep_2005-12-12_1_126	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I see the arrival, as a topic on our order of business, of the topic of the Europe-wide harmonisation of business taxation. The co-existence side by side within the EU, of 25 different tax systems, with marked differences not only in terms of the tax rates levied, but also of the manner in which profit is calculated, has, over the past ten years, led to one result above all others, in that the share of business tax in the funding of public budgets is on the way down, and a growing proportion of the tax burden is placed on the person who earns ordinary wages for working for someone else, or on the consumer, the latter of which is the worst possible solution in terms of its impact on society and on economic growth. It is in this way that big multinationals in particular are given every opportunity to minimise their tax burden. Transfer pricing and the shifting of losses are just two of their favourite ways of making sure that profits appear in the accounts at the precise place where the taxman is least inclined to stick his hand in. Quite apart from this sort of fiscal dumping, the co-existence of tax systems has prompted a competitive approach to cutting tax rates. The average corporation tax rate, for example, fell by a total of 15 percentage points across the old EU from the end of the 1980s onwards. One demonstration of the fact that these cuts are not by any means nominal is to be found in a long-term study by the University of Mannheim, according to which the amount of tax effectively paid by the 50 biggest European conglomerates fell from 36% in 1988 to a mere 31% in 2000, which means that billions of euros in public revenue have been given away and wasted. Bizarrely enough, the European leader of the tax dumping pack - particularly where company taxes are concerned - is neither an Eastern European state nor Ireland, but the Federal Republic of Germany, supposedly a high-tax country, where a tax reform forced through by the former Schröder Government - which justified its action by reference to fiscal competition across Europe - brought corporation tax yield to an utter standstill. Only the harmonisation of taxes across Europe can put a stop to this lunacy, which sees companies making enormous profits while taking less and less of a part in funding the community as a whole and people on average and low incomes - and, via taxes on consumption, even pensioners and the unemployed - ending up having to make good the shortfall. I do not, however, believe that it is enough to harmonise the tax base. What we need, as a matter of urgency, is a Europe-wide minimum tax rate for company profits of at least 40%, and on a broad tax base. Tax dumping is omnipresent, and this is the only way to stop it in its tracks.
costep_1999-04-15_11_18	Mr President, Commissioner, just when everyone has finally realised where East Timor is, the largest Islamic country in the world, Indonesia, is falling apart - we only need to think of Ambon, Madura, Aceh and Kalimantan. The state of Indonesia is about to become one huge battlefield. The forthcoming elections in June/July are of vital importance, and I think that if they are organised properly, they could form the basis for a different sort of federal Indonesia, all being well. This is why I think the European Union and, of course, the United Nations must do everything they can to help in the only way they can, to ensure that the elections are indeed democratic. All it will cost is a little money and effort. For goodness' sake, do not let this huge country, the 'emerald belt' as we call it in Dutch, become just a patch of rust in the Pacific.
costep_1998-05-14_9_4	Mr President, I shall try to be brief. The important thing is really to thank the rapporteur, for he has submitted an excellent report which has been unanimously approved in committee. With quite a few countries in the middle of election campaigns, it is always very nice to be able to say that a report has been carried unanimously because of its absolute objectivity. Thank you very much, Mr van Dam, for this report. Reform of the code of conduct is very sensible, and it will increase the objectivity of the information provided. The most important thing now is to include high speed trains in this system, so that people are better able to recognize those routes where it is more practical to take the train than to fly. This is something we want to see for shorter trips - in other words, more journeys by train than by aeroplane - in order to decongest air space and preserve the environment. In this respect the advantages are enormous. Unlike the Commission, I consider the display of code share flights to be a sensible move. Here I agree with the rapporteur. This system has proved to be very effective. Finally, I think it is right to produce a consolidated version of the three pieces of legislation, so they can be more clearly understood by consumers. In this respect, codification is something the Commission should be following up. I believe we can reach a consensus here: we have a good proposal and this is now to be improved upon by Mr van Dam. I hope the Commission accepts the rapporteur’s proposals and then everyone will be happy.
costep_2007-03-14_15_11	The Green Paper and the debate on trade policy instruments are extremely important to our economy and could bring us considerable added value. European foreign trade policy must respond adequately to any change that takes place in the manufacture and sale of goods on the internal and external markets. For example, in the framework of agreements, our market can promote the purchase of materials for biofuels, the sale of which has good development prospects, and restrict imports, thus reducing the output of the sugar industry, for instance. Through our mutual relationships we should help those of our suppliers who could start up production in line with our needs within the scope of promotional or association agreements. As far as dumping goes, our response is long-winded and indecisive, doing us more harm than good. For example, in the case of frozen strawberries from China it took several years to put anti-dumping measures in place, by which time numerous farms had folded and gone bankrupt. An analysis of operational efficiency, and radically shortening existing bureaucratic procedures could lead to clear working regulations and responsibilities which would allow applications to be processed quickly. Another problem for the European Union is defining the principles of our common trade policy to avoid unfair competition on the external market. The issues I have mentioned require constant monitoring. I thank other Members for engaging in the debate on this issue.
costep_1997-03-11_12_33	I thank the Commissioner for the information he has this afternoon given to this House. In any case it is very clear that there is still a long way to go and the pace is slow. In fact, as the Commissioner has told us, the cooperation agreement with Uzbekistan signed in June 1996 has been ratified by Uzbekistan only. I should like to ask whether Finland has ratified recently. In the case of Kazakhstan it was in fact seven. Kazakhstan itself has serious problems with the democratic deficit and has not ratified either. The case is similar for Kirghizstan. It appears that this Parliament, which has still not ratified any of the three agreements mentioned, is proposing to ratify the Kazakhstan agreement after tomorrow. In any event, as regards the three which the Commissioner mentioned, Mongolia, Turkmenistan and Tadzikistan, the process should be speeded up as far as possible since the main objective is to step up political dialogue with these countries.
costep_1998-04-02_5_2	Mr President, I refer to Rule 96 of the Rules of Procedure and would ask you not to open the debate now. My reasons are as follows. We have 6 minutes left before voting begins. Anyone who regularly spends time in the Chamber knows what will happen here in a few minutes time: a very undisciplined mass of Members will pour in, with no interest in any debate. They are only interested in the fact that voting is about to begin, and have no interest in the debate. That is unfortunate for Mr Posselt, the rapporteur, and Mrs Spaak, the draftsman of opinion, and also for those who are still to speak this afternoon. However, it is our duty to carry out these debates in a reasonably acceptable manner, and that is no longer possible. Secondly, Mr President, I would ask you to convey the protest of at least the Social Democrat members of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs to the Bureau of the European Parliament. Every time, we have the extraordinary pleasure of having to debate our reports at a time like this, which I think is inappropriate in view of the importance of the topics. Perhaps that could be taken into account in future scheduling.
costep_2008-07-08_6_26	Madam President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your compliments and would in turn pass them on to all those who have helped in this project. I would also like to thank you for the criticisms that have been expressed in some quarters. Allow me to clarify some things again: one of the speakers said that we had been indulging in back-room politics. I do not believe this was the case. The whole process was very open and the speaker himself was present at every stage, the shadow rapporteur was kept informed of all the details and in my group we also discussed matters among ourselves. I do not know if that also happened in the speaker’s group, but in any case for us it was all very open and above board, even on an internal level. We managed to get the Council of Ministers to accept many of our proposals. The Commissioner said that it was more ambitious than the original Commission proposal and the number of amendments alone that we succeeded in putting through - some 30 in all - shows that we were able to alter the common position, and in some cases quite substantially. Mr Lucas, Mr Holm and others have said that all this falls short of the expectations of the environmental groups. That is correct, but neither would it have been a good compromise if we had incorporated everything that the environmentalists and Greens had been demanding. In two areas - and the Commissioner also referred to these - there is still some room for adjustment. With the report presented by Avril Doyle we again have an opportunity to adjust the cap and the auctioning level so that they are fair to other participants in the emissions trading system We need to look very closely at this in the second half of the year. In conclusion I should again like to stress that what we want is equal terms of competition. We want a global agreement and we also want to include in it flights from third countries. However, it is about time that the airlines helped us out. I see a letter from the AEA - the Association of European Airlines - stating that even after the compromise has been reached other governments will understandably reject it. We need to consider whether we should still be engaging such people, as they make very poor lobbyists. We shall now be adopting this agreement with a very large majority and will then join forces to plead our case before third countries. Then we will all be working together. However, if Parliament’s democratic decision is not accepted we will have to tell the airlines that they are only harming themselves. I ask you to approve the recommendation and would like to express my thanks for the broad support I have received.
costep_2011-05-11_6_47	This report relates to the proposal for a directive of Parliament and of the Council on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs, in a codified text. Simplifying the lives of European citizens is one of the EU’s concerns. Many legislative changes have been carried out by the Commission and by Parliament in order to achieve this objective. One of the things which really complicates the life of the ordinary EU citizen is reading and interpreting information about the indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs. The proliferation of such information makes this more difficult and contributes to decreasing the public’s quality of life. To address this issue, since 1994, there has been an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the Council on an accelerated working method for the adoption of codified acts. I am happy to finally be able to adopt a directive that, in consolidating Directive 89/396/EEC, makes the public’s lives easier by simplifying and clarifying EU law.
costep_2009-03-09_15_12	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that on this highly significant occasion - the 50th anniversary of the uprising of the Tibetan people and the flight of the Dalai Lama - it is very important that our Parliament should express its views in a resolution and not just in a debate. This is not the first time: this Parliament has always stood by the Dalai Lama and the cause of the freedom of the Tibetan people and we cannot draw back now, not least because the situation is not getting any better. The situation is constantly deteriorating and even very recently we have been subject to intimidation by the Chinese Government regarding Tibetan freedom. I therefore feel it is crucial that we not only talk but also take decisions.
costep_1998-05-13_2_7	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on Saturday 2 May this Parliament celebrated the constitution of monetary union with eleven Member States of the Union. Monetary union brings with it a single currency, the euro. This decision marks the consolidation of a new and important advance in the economic and monetary dimension of the Union, which also has enormous political importance. The issuing of a currency implies sovereignty, and the single European currency expresses a European sovereignty which should result in a greater deepening of the political dimension of the Union. Unfortunately, when the time came for the European Council to propose the president, the vice-president and the other four members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, after the European Parliament had made its decision, elements of uncertainty were introduced. What should have been presented as a historic agreement was distorted in the public eye by a controversy which should never have happened. Luckily, the substance proved more important than the means, the international financial community has clearly demonstrated its acceptance of monetary union and the euro, and the proposed team has been warmly congratulated by the most internationally outstanding and prestigious economic and financial institutions. As regards the hearings held in the European Parliament, I want to say that the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party supports the proposals in the report presented by Mrs Randzio-Plath, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs. And as for the specific proposal about the president, we stress our full respect for his independence, including the mandate for which he has been proposed. At the hearing, the current president of the European Monetary Institute confirmed his qualities and personality, which we already knew from the contributions he had made in that capacity. We welcome his independence from any pressure which might limit the fulfilment of the objectives set for the European Central Bank by the Maastricht Treaty. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a new and very important stage in the consolidation of the euro is now beginning. The European Central Bank is the keystone for the fulfilment of the objectives set for it by the Treaty and we will watch to make sure this process is complied with in full transparency, and that the obligations the Board members committed themselves to at the various hearings are also complied with.
costep_2008-04-22_4_38	Mr President, I would like to express our satisfaction as, for another year, transparency has been improved in the European Union accounts, despite the fact that, we have to say, the Court of Auditors is still helping us with the more fundamental aspects of the system. It is, however, true that, through a very constructive dialogue - arduous but very constructive - with the Commission, in which we must especially recognise the efforts made by the Commissioners for Regional Development and Employment, there has been real progress made on aspects of improving monitoring of all aspects related to both employment and the Structural Funds. We would have liked the same cooperation from the Commissioner on External Relations, who we hope will add to or join in these efforts. With regard to the Committee of the Regions, we are very happy, because we have really made very significant progress, and while we are continuing to evaluate and monitor affairs we feel that there has really been major progress. With regard to the Court of Auditors, we would like there to be greater transparency in its declaration of interests, and regarding the Council we agree with making internal auditing more transparent and efficient, but not with increasing bureaucratic obstacles, as the amendment tabled appears to suggest.
costep_2001-02-13_2_7	Madam President, my group too warmly supports the approach whereby the main priorities are actually set forth in this discussion, and just for a moment we can ignore the 'business as usual' attitude that we do tend to encounter in our everyday work here. Right at the start I wish to say that the fact that the Union lacks the tools to work in such a way that it is actually able to answer the challenges of increasing globalisation, for example, and the tools to enable it to protect its citizens from the chaotic effects of this globalisation, is becoming a major problem. I am now referring to the fact that at the Nice Summit it proved utterly impossible to take the decision that, in future, matters to do with taxation might be decided upon by means of a qualified majority. This means that we shall be leaving this area of taxation to market forces. We are to allow market forces to shape our tax system, and this will obviously be a major obstacle to our being able to build what we here call the European social model, in which we want to steer the development of society by means of taxation. Population growth was mentioned here. It is absolutely clear that we must combat growing racism, as we will not otherwise be in any way able to deal with immigrants and asylum seekers. In this we all have a great public responsibility. Madam President, very often strong words are uttered in this House on the subject of our citizens. Here today, too, it has been said many times over that the public must be included in the decision-making process, although, unfortunately, this very often gets forgotten in practice. I will take one very topical example of this. The institutions are at this very moment trying to put together a regulation on transparency, which would safeguard the right of the public to acquire information on decision making in the Union. I would like to warn my colleagues and all those present that now it appears that this regulation on transparency is turning into more of a regulation to shield the confidentiality of the work of the institutions, or, in other words, it has precisely the opposite objective. We cannot accept this sort of thing, and we also need more public debate on this issue. Neither can this matter be discussed entirely in camera, as is happening at the moment. Madam President, sustainable development was mentioned by President Prodi in his opening address, and this is a major objective as far as my group is concerned. If we do not succeed at Gothenburg in achieving a real programme of sustainable development we will have wasted an opportunity that perhaps will not return again. It is here, if anywhere, that the Commission must demonstrate leadership and set forth its views. But it would seem that there are always problems with this in practice. Today the Commission will publish its White Paper on policy on chemicals, but I have reason to suppose that the Commission’s approach to this too will be to protect the short-sighted financial interests of industry rather than guarantee that we would actually be rid of hazardous chemicals. This is something we cannot possibly accept as we are speaking about sustainable development. Environmental competitiveness is something that should be taken seriously, and the Commission would be better off listening to companies and financial players that have realised that sustainable development can also be good business. Major reform in agriculture is at present under discussion, and we want to encourage it, and we insist that the Commission take a comprehensive view and not just content itself with taking small steps forward. In this we can look forward to a real change in the paradigm. To conclude, Madam President, if you will allow, Annex IV of the Treaty of Nice is certainly the best thing about this agreement. It states the enormous obligation of Parliament, the Commission and the Council also, and the Swedish Presidency, to take seriously our re-evaluation of the process that underlies the structure of the European Union. My group fully supports your initiative regarding our obligation to include civil society in this debate over the next six months prior to the Laeken Summit, as well, obviously, as the national parliaments and indeed those of candidate countries. It saddens me when I hear that my colleague, Mr Barón Crespo, wants to point out here that we must be mainly satisfied to listen to national parliaments. No, civil society is very much a reality. We will have to take it seriously finally and we should no longer have to witness any Intergovernmental Conference in which just the national interests are safeguarded, with all this happening behind closed doors.
costep_2008-01-17_3_9	Mr President, the role of women in industry is clearly conditioned - this has already been stated, and I wish to remind you of it - as in many other cases, by a number of stereotypes, some of which are clearly pernicious. We need to make headway on overcoming such stereotypes and that is precisely why I feel the Figueiredo report is a fundamental and important concept and, similarly, why it enjoys the support of our group. There is much evidence to justify this report and the submission of a number of proposals, which we trust will be welcomed not only by the Community institutions, but by business itself, which, after all, has to adopt them and implement them. One such piece of evidence is the fact that the European Union average in terms of women employed in industry is a mere 14%. It must nevertheless also be borne in mind that, of this percentage, 21% accounts for part-time employees; indeed, women account for 65% of part-time employees in the industrial sector. I feel that this is one of the key aspects, and by no means a minor issue in this debate. The second piece of evidence is the fact that it is precisely women with precarious employment conditions, women working part-time, carrying out temporary employment in atypical conditions, that are most frequently affected by wage discrimination or, when they wish to take maternity leave, have fewer possibilities in terms of basic, permanent and vocational training. Thus the proposals in this report include the proposal for urgent measures to be adopted for full and effective application of Directive 75/117 EEC on the principle of equal pay for men and women as a means of opposing wage discrimination. We have been calling for this for some time now, and hope to see it implemented as soon as possible. Secondly, we want incentives to be provided for initiatives, positive courses of action and policies for human resources to promote equality. We want the Member States and the Commission to provide more and better tax breaks for companies in terms of compliance with codes of conduct and corporate social responsibility criteria in their day-to-day business. We want to see better working conditions, with particular emphasis on working hours, and maternity and paternity leave - here responsibility is shared on both sides by the couple or the family - thereby guaranteeing working men and women the opportunity to take up their posts again after such leave. Attention must also be paid to reconciling work and family life. Thus, for all this to be transformed into reality, the report calls for these rights to be implemented in legislation across the European Union. Finally, I beg to differ with Mr Dover on the subject of quotas. For some of us, female and male, these constitute a necessary instrument, and thus we feel the point must be made that the European Union ought to follow the Norwegian example of applying measures to increase the numbers of female board members of public utilities to at least 40%, and use regulations to impose a 40% quota of female representation on boards of private companies. It is obvious that this is not the solution, but I must insist that this is a path and a means that is proving useful in other aspects, which we would like to see copied within the European Union.
costep_1998-05-14_6_4	Madam President, when you talk about the Sudan, you are talking about my family. My two children were born there, and the country means something to me. To see 400 000 people once again near starvation, it gets me, it gets everyone. Especially if you know that the cause is the ceasefire which has not been declared by the governing party, let alone by the resistance movement in the south. The Union must increase pressure to the maximum. They must be persuaded to take up the numerous peace initiatives again. I would have thought all types of pressure are legitimate, including the freezing of IMF and World Bank funds, because 400 000 to 500 000 human lives are at risk. In the meantime, this same Union must not renege on the humanitarian front. That is why I thank Commissioner Marín, and in any case the Commission, for the recent ECHO flight with ECU 8.8 million in emergency aid. People must not lose interest in the helpless Sudanese.
costep_2010-03-25_11_80	At a time of serious social crisis, with increased poverty and unemployment resulting from the crisis of capitalism, this 65th Session of the United Nations General Assembly becomes even more important. There are many issues of interest at global level. Of particular importance is monitoring progress towards achievement of the Millennium Development Goals as minimum targets to be hit by 2015. Any attempt to reduce, weaken or postpone the promises made must be fought. It is therefore important to attempt to reach agreement between developed and developing countries on speeding up progress. This must include clear and specific commitments, as the international community is a long way off honouring its commitments regarding the Millennium Development Goals. If appropriate measures are not taken, we could have nearly 1.5 billion workers in poverty because of unemployment or insecure and badly paid jobs.
costep_2011-01-17_18_38	I am very pleased that the European Parliament is looking at the question of adoption in the Union today, because this is something which is especially dear to me. The particular references to children in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union make it possible for us to take up this question, and they also oblige us to do so. International adoption can mean the chance of a normal life and a happy family for many abandoned children who, because of their age or health, have no chance of being adopted in their own country. In Europe today, we are facing a situation in which in countries where abortion has been accepted and is widely available, there are not many children for adoption, while in other countries, there are many such children, and apart from the youngest of them, they have no chance of finding a family of their own. Furthermore, there is a growing number of couples who find it difficult to have their own children or who are affected by fertility problems which cannot be treated. So I am very enthusiastic about the work of the European Commission in this area. The Member States should come to an agreement on the question of simplifying procedures so that they will not be too complicated or protracted. We must not, however, forget to put in place systems for protection and monitoring, in order to prevent child trafficking.
costep_2001-10-02_7_12	Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and congratulate her on having appeared so quickly before this House to give us this important information today. Although she gave a general reply earlier in relation to Spain, I would like, if you will permit me, to ask about a specific aspect which has a lot to do with peripheral regions, or rather the most peripheral of the peripheral regions - the Galician Finisterre. I would like to ask you whether these new guidelines approved by the Commission, in relation to Spain and the high speed railway, include connections with the Autonomous Community of Galicia and, if so, whether you can explain how.
costep_2007-09-05_14_8	Madam President, as I believe Mrs Valenciano has shown very clearly in her excellent report, we are overflowing with concrete proposals that will certainly be very useful to the Portuguese Presidency, as it has stated its aim to achieve tangible results on human rights and democracy. We have for some time been calling for greater coherence, transparency and results in our discussions with third countries, jointly with the Commission and the Council. All that remains is actually to go from words to action. I am convinced that you know as well as I do that all it takes is organisation to make human rights dialogues more effective, beyond their diversity. Firstly, this means setting up clear, public objectives assigned to each dialogue so that a coherent, shared strategy, appropriated at the highest level, emerges. Secondly, it means setting up indicators to allow proper evaluation of the results achieved by a dialogue and informing MEPs of them so that, for example when a delegation visits the country, they can check what progress has been made and discuss it with civil society and human rights activists, to be better able to question their partners on the commitments made within the framework of the dialogue. On this score, we are still waiting to be informed of the indicators that should be used to evaluate the dialogue recently established with Uzbekistan. Thirdly, it means guaranteeing that human rights are taken into account in all the EU’s external policies, including trade policy, migration policy and the fight against terrorism. It is our credibility in talking about human rights that is at stake here. For example, can anyone explain how we can currently be discussing the implementation of guidelines against torture with Jordan in the Subcommittee on Human Rights, the first subcommittee to be set up under the neighbourhood policy, today held up as a model, when we know that European Member States have covered up the subcontracting of torture by the CIA? How can we be discussing torture and the fight against it in this subcommittee? Our first job as MEPs is to evaluate the pertinence of the EU’s action, and to do this, you can count on the delegations, the committees and the whole Parliament, which will continue to fight for its application every step of the way, whether it means launching, reorientating or, if necessary, stopping a dialogue.
costep_2000-03-16_2_20	Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for the successful work that has been done in so short a period of time. An information society for all is certainly an area of focus for the Commissioner in this process. It is important, and I thank her for it. Agreement should be reached at Lisbon on the principles of the sustainable funding of social security on account of this notion. We also have to reach agreement with management and labour, for example, on the subject of remote working and vocational training, if what we are talking about is an information society for all. It will not be so if the basic rights of employees are not safeguarded. There is a threat that, because of the Internet, services will become self-services, and that again is a major employment issue. Another matter is that we have been deregulating the telecommunications industry for around ten years, and now, with these massive Internet players merging there is a fear that they will once again start regulating the market. This, I think, should be stopped. It cannot be allowed to happen and I expect the Commission to sit up and listen and take the necessary action. Thirdly, the quoted share value for a certain Internet company rose by a sudden 4 000% in one month, and this came about merely because unsubstantiated information was given about it for the stock market. With many companies in the same position, or almost the same position, there is going to be a bubble effect in the industry, and when the crash comes I hope the taxpayer will not be footing the bill. Has the Commissioner a remedy in mind for if and when the air balloon companies in this sector burst so that the taxpayer does not have to pay out, as is the case with crises in the banks, for example?
costep_2009-09-14_21_30	Mr President, Commissioner Dimas, this is the first time I have been an MEP - I was elected on 7 June - but from the debate, it is clear that this matter comes back every September after the wave of devastating fires that particularly affect southern Europe: Italy, France, Greece and Spain. Mention has already been made of the devastating fire on the island of La Palma, in the outermost region of the Canaries, a Spanish autonomous community where I was born and where I live. What is important however, is that we are aware that, although it is particularly intense on the southern borders of Europe, here we have an opportunity to increase the affection and connection that citizens have with what Europe means: added value in terms of the response. This means European added value in prevention and European added value in the coordination of the institutions: the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament with the resolution, in cooperation with the Member States. However, there also needs to be European added value in the response. This is why it is important that we move from debate to action, by making the Solidarity Fund more flexible in response to emergencies, and that we start up this European civil protection force, which is still pending, and which is what could really make a difference in the future when we are faced with these emergencies, which recur every summer as a result of climate change and global warming.
costep_2004-01-12_1_90	It is scandalous that we have had to wait for the loss of the before adopting more or less constraining directives with a view finally to applying rules dating back thirty years. It is no less scandalous that the victims of previous losses, such as that of the, are not always properly compensated and that the oil corporation, Total, which is responsible for the loss, is cynical enough to claim compensation for pumping costs. Some amendments are designed to water down the Commission’s wordings on the pretext of avoiding a witch hunt against the captains and crews. This is all very well, but why are the directives only aimed at the latter? Why not implicate the people who are really responsible, namely those who organise the shipments? Why not prevent them from causing harm by applying genuinely dissuasive sanctions, for, if ships are able to sail under flags of convenience and if determining who owns them is sometimes a real headache, the big companies that profit from these shipments, notably the oil corporations, are, for their part, perfectly identifiable. It is against these groups that the most severe measures should be taken in order to prevent the race for profits leading to collective tragedies.
costep_2001-06-13_3_32	Madam President, it may well be that the issue concerns the elderly as well, but it is extremely important in terms of young people and, above all, children. We know how many children watch television and how often they watch it alone, without parental supervision, without, that is, the filter provided by the family, or maybe not the family, given that the statistics show that many children are born out of wedlock. From this point of view, therefore, the Harbour report is important, and I am saying this precisely on behalf of the young people of our continent, on behalf of the many young people who approach us and tell us to concern ourselves with broadcasts - not to mention the conflicts of interests and monopolies which have been discussed so often in recent days - and I would add that it is important precisely for young people and children that the European Union legislates on this matter. Lulling report A5-0181/2001
costep_2010-10-07_13_188	As I have already had occasion to mention, in relation to the report by Mrs de Lange that was put to the vote in the last part-session, 'I () agree with the need for the EU in its entirety, and particularly those areas covered by Community policies, to find a sustainable strategy for protecting biodiversity and preserving ecosystems. I believe that this becomes particularly relevant in the area of agriculture and fisheries, for which reason I am monitoring particularly closely the reforms of the common fisheries policy and the common agricultural policy that are being prepared. This is because the adequate and sustainable preservation of biodiversity, while essential and desirable, cannot be a brake on the sustainability and development of agriculture and fishing.'
costep_2002-12-05_4_40	Mr President, I welcome the Commission’s intention to make the EU the first supranational democracy in the world. That is a fantastic project, and people understand it and support it. In any democracy, the government is elected by parliament, and that is why I also welcome the proposal that here in the EU the Commission and its President should at last be elected by this House and not by the European Council. The present approach is really topsy-turvy, and I think that we need to reinstate Montesquieu’s principles. So I congratulate you on having managed to get there. This is a really important point, and one where Parliament and the Commission can now pull in the same direction. I would also like to congratulate you on clearly advocating that there should be just one executive and not two. There cannot be an elected President of the European Council alongside the elected President of the Commission. We do not want the institutions to be renationalised, what we need is to apply the Community method, and in this paper the Commission and Parliament are on the same track. We must get that through in the Convention!
costep_2006-10-11_19_18	Mr President, before I give my reaction, I should like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for her excellent report and the good balance she has struck between what is and is not possible and what we want for animal welfare in Europe; I should also like to respond to Mr Titford’s remark to the effect that European bureaucracy is responsible for the slaughter of 7 million animals in Great Britain during the foot-and-mouth crisis. I should like to put him right on that score: When Great Britain joined the European Union, Europe was forced to change its legislation. We were no longer allowed to vaccinate as a preventive measure. We were no longer allowed to vaccinate for foot-and-mouth disease. We owe this to the British Government at the time, so please do not try to tell me that Europe is to blame for the slaughter of 7 million cows in Great Britain, for it has everything to do with the British position at the time. I just wanted to get that off my chest. I am also saying this, because Mrs Jeggle’s report states quite clearly that vaccination should be a valid instrument for improved animal welfare in the European Union. In view of the outbreaks of infectious animal diseases, it is good we are making some headway and are in any event using scientific techniques in order to fight them. That is the best form of animal welfare in Europe. A second point I wanted to raise concerns animal transport. We in this House have asked for a reduction in the duration of transport that involves animals intended for slaughter. Unfortunately, the Council has not taken this on board, but the position of Parliament is clear. In that sense, I should like to urge Mr Titford, if he really wishes to protect animal welfare in his own country too, to vote in favour of the Jeggle report. That is essential, for then you will really do the citizens of Great Britain and those of Europe a good turn. The third reason why I welcome this report is that it draws particular attention to the import of products from outside of the European Union. After all, we may have fine rules and regulations, but if we cannot carry out any monitoring on Europe’s external borders, then they will remain immaterial; it is essential that this House should use the Jeggle report to put this back on the agenda.
costep_2005-02-22_1_177	Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wishes to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Grosch, on his excellent report on the Commission’s proposal for a third Directive on driving licences. He has presented detailed proposals for improvements relating to the future introduction of a uniform European driving licence and, most importantly, has drawn up people-friendly provisions, such as those dealing with caravans and campers. He has also tabled clear proposals for improvements in the realm of so-called driving-licence tourism. The cause of road safety is not served by allowing someone whose licence has been revoked with good reason to obtain a new one immediately in a neighbouring country. In this respect, Mr Grosch has made an excellent job of fleshing out the principle of eliminating licence tourism. There are, however, two points in the report which my group rejects. Like the Commission, Mr Vice-President, we oppose the compulsory exchange of existing driving licences. Road safety is not improved in any way by making people go to a public authority, have a new photograph taken and be issued with a new licence document. At best, such an arrangement facilitates police checks, but it does nothing to improve road safety. If the benefit of simpler police checks is compared with the trouble and inconvenience to which drivers would be put - tens of thousands of them, if not more, who will never drive in another EU country would still be required to obtain a new licence - the inconvenience outweighs any benefits, and my group joins the Commission in opposing such a provision. The second point we reject in the report relates to the compulsory limitation of the validity of licence documents. This does nothing to enhance road safety either. It only means that people have to go to the authorities, have a new photograph taken and be issued with a new licence document, even though, as the rapporteur rightly recognises, the authorisation resulting from the original driving test remains valid. I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to help us by supporting our position for the sake of the people of Europe. We do not want the compulsory exchange of driving licences, and we do not want any limitation of their validity.
costep_2009-04-24_3_2	Today, as the European Union’s economy experiences a period of recession, it is very important to stimulate economic growth. One of the sources of the European Union’s economic growth is the expansion of the common market, which is still very fragmented, especially in the area of financial services. The proposal before us should help solve this problem and establish a common European payment area. In English this is called the Single Euro Payments Area. This document already has some history. As soon as the euro was introduced and the currency exchange rates were abolished in euro zone countries, it became clear that prices for cross-border payments still differed from prices for local payments. For this reason Regulation (EC) No 2560 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in euro was adopted and entered into force at the end of 2001. It set equal charges for corresponding local, national payments and cross-border payments and strengthened this principle. The aim of this was to reduce prices for consumers and ensure greater competition in the payment services market. Implementing this regulation reduced payment fees; for example, a cross-border transfer of EUR 100 used to cost an average of EUR 24 in the European Union, now it costs EUR 2.50. On the other hand, the document revealed certain deficiencies. For this reason it was decided that it should be revised. The document before us is an improved version of Regulation No 2560. What is new in the document? Firstly, the principle of equality of charges for cross-border and corresponding domestic payments has been extended to include direct debit. This was not previously available. Once the SEPA had been created and the Payment Services Directive had been adopted, the payment environment in Europe changed; therefore, it is important that from November 2009 it will be possible to use the popular electronic payment method, direct debit, on a cross-border basis. In order to help create that common direct debit model, the regulation states that in the absence of a bilateral agreement between the payment service providers of the payer and the payee, the level of the default interim Multilateral Interchange Fee for a direct debit will be set at EUR 0.08 for a transitional period until 2012. The document also outlines how to improve the defence of consumer rights and remove obstacles to business. It is proposed that Member States appoint competent authorities to supervise the implementation of this regulation, and those authorities should also actively cooperate across nations, so that there are fewer obstacles to business; they could also lay down guidelines on how to assess procedures for determining compliance with the principle. Another novelty the revision of this document offers is the proposal to gradually abolish obligations imposed on banks in certain states to provide balance-of-payments statistics and the laying down of other procedures for providing balance-of-payments statistics. I am very sorry that an agreement with the Council could not be reached on this point and for the time being the balance-of-payments revision procedures and implementation procedures have still to be defined. Parliament and the Commission have declared that a strict deadline would be set.
costep_2010-05-05_14_360	I voted against the resolution on banning the use of cyanide mining technologies by the end of 2011 for a number of reasons. Halting current mining projects using cyanide technologies would deal a severe blow to the Member States using this technology (Finland, Sweden, Spain, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece) and to the Member States which produce cyanides (Belgium, the UK, Czech Republic and Germany). Europe would become 100% dependent on importing gold, a metal used in Europe’s precious metals industry, as well as in the electronics sector. Approximately 87% of cyanide production is used in other industrial sectors outside the mining industry, such as the production of vitamins, jewellery, adhesives, electronic components for computers, fireproof insulation materials, cosmetics, nylon, paints, medicines, and so on. There are technologies in the economic sector which pose a hazard to human health and the environment. Cyanide technology is just one of them. Regulations and standards are in place to allow such activities to be carried out in safe conditions, in order to prevent any adverse impact. This principle applies to mining technology as well. There is legislation in force which must be respected. We do not have the right to ban, but we do have the right to protect.
costep_2008-01-31_10_32	As in the case of the report on Switzerland and Liechtenstein, we believe it is important to stress that, in general, these agreements should be made in a broader framework that also aims to promote the rights of immigrant workers and to protect them against the appalling phenomenon of exploitation, by fostering the effective exercise of their rights and their integration, for example, guaranteeing the right to family reunification, applying the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families - we would stress that it has yet to be ratified by any EU Member State - drafted under the auspices of the UN, an international legal instrument that aims to safeguard the defence of the human rights of migrant workers, particularly the unalienable right to family life. In other words, facilitating the movement of citizens between the various countries should not be used as a means of facilitating the exploitation of cheap temporary labour that is easily 'discarded', of increasing exploitation and pressure on wages, of promoting precarious conditions, of deregulating labour relations, fuelling a retrograde step in terms of workers' rights and social conditions as a whole, but rather to combat such phenomena.
costep_2011-03-23_17_17	Madam President, Japan is still under threat of nuclear meltdown. Radiation from the nuclear power plant in Fukushima is rising dramatically. This is yet another horrific demonstration of how impossible it is to control nuclear power. That is why we are calling for an immediate abandonment of nuclear energy. Nuclear energy lines the pockets of the power companies, but when an accident occurs it is the people who pay the price. For this reason, the EU must immediately lay down a requirement for the operators of nuclear power plants to hold mandatory public liability insurance. Sufficient cover must be provided for all damage to health, property and other assets in all Member States. The European Union should finally halt the promotion of nuclear energy and terminate the Euratom Treaty. Billions in taxpayers' money is still being poured into a dangerous, high-risk technology, while safe alternatives like renewable energies remain under-funded.
costep_2002-01-16_11_32	Mr President, in view of the importance of the matter, I would just like to ask the Commissioner to clarify something. In any case, I would like to thank him for all his comments, which were certainly important from my point of view, although I do maintain - and I will do so tomorrow - that Parliament should have the autonomy to decide on a political basis rather than on the basis of other factors. However, his response regarding Amendment No 147 does not make sense at all: while the Commission is against raising the thresholds - which, as was said during the hearings, meetings and debates within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I believe is because it wants the directives on works contracts to be applied as widely as possible - according to what the Commissioner has just said, raising the thresholds would actually reduce the number of works contracts. Now then, Amendment No 147 seeks specifically to open up works contracts to competition, and I cannot understand why the Commission is opposed to this. I would be grateful to the Commissioner if, either now or later in private, by some means or other, he could explain to me what part of Amendment No 147 is unacceptable. It is important, Mr President, for this is no trivial matter. I repeat, if it is not appropriate to do so now because it is time to suspend our work or move on to something else, I am quite prepared, if the Commissioner agrees, even to meet him afterwards so that he can explain to me what is wrong with Amendment No 147, which, as I see it, ensures that absolutely all works contracts, of whatever type, can be governed by European legislation.
costep_2002-10-22_2_110	Madam President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the two rapporteurs. Every year I am shocked at the huge amount of work they have to do. What are my general comments on the budget? It is widely known, also from previous years, that I am a great fan of carrying out what we have agreed as far as possible. We should thus remain committed to the financial perspectives. This year too, there are a number of budgetary items which go beyond these financial perspectives. This is particularly the case in category 4. We should, in my opinion, adopt a flexible stance for once. As far as the necessary expenditure for Afghanistan and the Global Health Fund is concerned, I believe we should use the flexibility instrument and confer with the Council. Whenever I discuss the budget, I cannot help but mention agricultural spending. I have once again tabled a host of amendments, and I hope that if they are approved by the plenary, the Council will be prepared to adopt them. We currently have an FMD investigation committee, which has made a number of recommendations on which you will be able to vote later on this year. However, a number of things are already clear. It is unacceptable for us to slaughter animals on a large scale again in the future, as we have done in the past. This is why I have tabled amendments for developing better vaccines and better testing methods, distinguishing between infected animals and inoculated animals, and so on. Also, in my opinion - which is incidentally universally endorsed - agricultural production should focus on quality. The public, however, should know what quality is. Europe needs to develop its own quality system which is readily recognisable to its customers, and funding has been made available for this purpose, provided the system is effective. Finally, with regard to the cost of controlling animal diseases, I believe that it is unacceptable for us to earmark a relatively small amount in the budget for this purpose every year, while every year it becomes apparent that if a real epidemic were to break out somewhere, it would cost billions. In my view, we need to develop European insurance systems. Finally, I have noticed that cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament has been good to date. I hope that this will continue to be the case in future.
costep_2010-05-19_3_80	The way out of the economic crisis is a bumpy one and, in addition, the fiscal problems in Greece and other Member States have rocked the euro area. These problems have raised the question as to whether Europe is capable of competing with the economic strength of the United States or China. With its EU 2020 strategy, the European Union must, therefore, give an effective response to the economic and financial crisis and ensure that the economic capacity of this bloc of 500 million people remains competitive, in other words, that the EU27 do not fall behind their economic and political rivals. The complexity of today’s challenges requires an integrated set of political instruments. The EU must give primary importance to research and innovation in tackling challenges such as climate change and finding solutions to increasing global competition. Since, in the period after the crisis, providing stimulus to growth and to job creation through research and innovation has become more important than ever, I suggest that this be set as the prime objective of the EU 2020 strategy. We are justified in our concern, however, that the current budget does not adequately cover the monetary needs to meet the challenges of the 21st century. As a member of the Committee on Budgets, I ask the European Commission to propose a new budget model that is bold and ambitious but also practicable, in order to guarantee the success of the EU 2020 strategy.
costep_2011-04-04_23_2	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by sincerely thanking all those with whom I have had the opportunity to work on this issue. All the contributions have helped in the drafting of this report and, thanks to the cooperation of all the political groups, and I am especially grateful to the shadow rapporteurs, we have on the table today a consistent text that sends out a powerful message. Indeed, we are at a turning point in European investment policy and at a time when we have to seize the new power conferred on us by the Treaty of Lisbon in order to meet a dual challenge. Firstly, that of providing European businesses with the tools they need for high quality foreign investment that is protected by a legal framework providing long-term support. Secondly, Europe must strengthen its position as the world’s leading beneficiary of foreign direct investment and give itself the means to control that investment so as to encourage sustainable development that creates high quality employment. By voting on this report, the first official expression of our institution since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, Parliament is fully assuming its role as a new colegislator in trade regulatory matters and is voicing its priorities at a time when the first investment protection negotiations are about to begin. This expression is essential, because it is intended to relay the concerns of the citizens, who are showing a growing interest in trade matters and whom we must support. In a world, today, where conflicts also take place in a trade context, protecting those businesses of ours that invest abroad must become a priority. International agreements have been created to protect investors from harsh, unjustified expropriations and hidden laws aimed simply at eliminating them from this or that market. This primary objective must be maintained. Although Europe is one of the most open markets in the world, a balance must be restored with our main partners so that European businesses can benefit from a level playing field. This is the proposal made in this report, which stresses the need for future agreements to include standards relating to non-discrimination, fair and equitable treatment, and protection against direct and indirect expropriation. However, those standards must be defined in such a way as to prevent any misinterpretation. Some businesses have, in fact, used the vague wording in first-generation investment agreements to protect their interests beyond what is legitimate, for example, by attacking new social and environmental laws that harm their interests. Appearing before international arbitrators and with no transparency or possibility of appeal, they have demanded considerable compensation by claiming that those laws are on a par with indirect expropriation. Europe, which, in the future, will receive ever more investment, particularly from emerging countries, must guard against such abuses. That is the idea behind the reforms undertaken by the United States and Canada, two countries whose governments and authorities have suffered several setbacks in international arbitration cases and which have radically overhauled their investment agreement model. By proposing new definitions of protection standards, the report strikes a fair balance between the protection of investors' rights and the right of public authorities to regulate. This also means including in all future agreements specific clauses laying down the possibility for public authorities to legislate and regulate in the areas of national security, the environment, public health, workers' and consumers' rights, industrial policy and cultural diversity. Lastly, increased protection for investors must be accompanied by more responsible behaviour, particularly in developing countries, where the social and environmental laws are less binding. That is why the report mentions that social and environmental clauses should be included in all free trade agreements signed by the Union. Furthermore, we must go beyond naming and shaming and include in all future agreements a set of clear corporate social responsibility rules with which businesses must comply and which are based on guidelines set by the OECD. If our aim here really is to shape the contours of a new European investment policy, then I call in this report for it to be exemplary and to promote investment which is sustainable, respects the environment and encourages good quality working conditions in Europe and in third countries alike. That is why this report, by the power vested in it by Wednesday’s vote, must serve as a reference for all future negotiations conducted by the Commission.
costep_2010-02-11_4_23	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations, Commissioner, and welcome. Everyone has seen how the online gambling market has boomed over the last few years, capturing economic and media attention. This is a phenomenon that involves new social groups and that is characterised by poly-consumption. Technology makes it easier to access and enables an increasing number of consumers - often young people, who are generally more familiar with computers and the Internet - to become involved. The dream of changing one’s life through gambling often has disastrous consequences, and many families are dragged into a negative situation from which there is often no means of escape. Moreover, there can be no underestimating the serious harm caused by the lack of social contact and interaction of online gamblers. The loneliness and the basic invisibility of gamblers characterise a generally unacceptable addiction. Gambling is a vice that appears still today to be largely hidden. In my previous role as the chief executive of a public health authority, I opened a specialist department for pathological gambling. The proposed intervention model has proven successful because the treatment combines the therapy aspect with that of prevention, research and rehabilitation. We need to intervene by adopting a common position and ensure that all addictions are subject to a robust form of governance. This has not been the case: I am referring to drug abuse, alcohol abuse, tobacco abuse, food and Internet addictions. I regret that the question put by myself and a further 42 MEPs has not yet been referred to Parliament in plenary because of opposition from the left. I therefore wonder how much interest the Commission really takes in those who have a proven problem with drug addiction or another proven addiction, and how important a role the fight against drug trafficking plays in the Commission’s programme.
costep_2002-04-10_3_94	Mr President, this report - which I voted for - is on the subject of the European Coal and Steel Community. I discussed the matter with a miner from the town of Gorno in the province of Bergamo, where I have lived for a long time, and he asked me why I was coming to Strasbourg today. So I told him about this financial report by Mr Seppänen, and he asked me to tell the House - which, as always when I deliver my explanations of vote, is present in large numbers - that we must make sure we take greater care of those who work in the pits, as he does in Gorno, mining coal for example, so that they will live longer and be less afflicted by illness during their working lives. I therefore hope that provision for this will be made in the ECSC budget too.
costep_2011-03-10_5_29	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as my fellow Member, Mr Marinescu, has already pointed out, the volcanic ash crisis demonstrated that Europe was neither strategically nor technologically prepared for this situation. I would like to draw the Commission’s attention to the fact that this also had a strong effect on the dissemination of, and access to, information. Due to the communications chaos, the negative effects of the crisis were felt by disadvantaged groups such as families with small children and persons with disabilities, who were unable to react appropriately. I ask the Commission whether, after April 2010, and in a similar crisis situation, every travelling citizen will have access to adequate information in order to appropriately exercise their right to information.
costep_2010-02-10_8_67	Croatia is demonstrating its determination to join the EU by taking clear steps towards fulfilling the criteria. Political will has been reflected in reforms of the public administration and judiciary and in the fight against corruption and organised crime. In the judiciary, there has been a growth in transparency, a reduction in the numbers of pending court proceedings and excessively long proceedings. One significant factor is the continuing exposure of war crimes, in which Croatia is fully cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal. Croatia is showing a good level of regulatory harmonisation with the acquis communautaire. It is undergoing significant legislative and institutional changes with the aim of combating organised crime and the mafia and strengthening cross-border cooperation with law-enforcement authorities in neighbouring countries. The banking sector in Croatia is sound, investors have confidence in the state of the economy, and macro-economic stability has been maintained. There is still a need to complete the programme of small-scale privatisations and reduce state interference in the economy. In my opinion, the reconciliation between ethnic Croats and ethnic Serbs, the improved safeguarding of minority rights and the integration of refugees, including the rebuilding of homes, are particularly deserving of praise. I therefore urge Croatia to further the development of a culture of political responsibility and for a public debate on membership and the consequences of accession, since only a third of the population currently consider accession to the EU to be beneficial. I would also like to congratulate the new commissioner, Mr Füle, and welcome him to the role.
costep_2000-07-04_10_4	Mr President, I shall endeavour to act on your good advice. The supplementary and amending budget presented here should not pose any major problems for the simple reason that, if adopted - and it is good to see that Parliament has an opportunity to introduce several elements and budgetary choices that suit it and are to its liking, generally speaking, it is a draft that the Council will consider positive as well. In fact, as far as this draft budget is concerned, the Council is the outright winner and legitimately so; not by scoring a victory against us, rather it is a winner all round. This is because this budget is essentially designed to enable the Council to recover the surplus balances from last year, which amount to EUR 3.2 billion. It includes a lower contribution in terms of the British rebate and a greater yield in own resources, for example customs duties, all of which is deducted from the costs it has to bear. The draft presented here can therefore be considered positively by both the Council and Parliament. This is firstly because during the trialogue, we all agreed that the budget presented should not be limited to merely returning the balances to the Member States, but should also include expenditure and constitute a genuine supplementary and amending budget. For Parliament this represents a limited victory but a significant one nonetheless. In the second place, we have made several decisions that can be viewed in a positive light. First, we have introduced a special contribution for orphan drugs of up to EUR 1 million. Thanks to the legal basis that now exists we are able to fund these orphan drugs. This is considered a priority by the committee responsible, the Committee on Budgets and Parliament itself. Second - and this is the second major contribution to the issue - we have introduced extra resources, which total some EUR 11 million. Five million are to go to the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and six million to the United Nations interim mission in Kosovo to fund the interim civil administrations. Once again, the legal bases exist to make these possible. We have the resources, the needs are there, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina are top priorities and we have chosen to finance them, but the question is how. This is to be achieved using commitment appropriations from the ECIP appropriations that no longer serve a purpose and, though they exist as appropriations, the absence of legal basis means that they cannot be used. It is therefore expenditure that has been secured by a sacrifice that barely costs us anything. The third significant element relates to the financing of the special aid for Montenegro. You will be aware that we were all against this aid being financed with resources from other foreign programmes, in particular the MEDA programme. We therefore decided to fund it using the margin which totals 21 million in this heading. We need 20 million. Budgetary history works in our favour in this case and by using almost this entire margin, this initiative can be financed without any reduction or transfer from other appropriations, which is highly satisfactory. Now - and I shall end on this point - the main question that remains to be answered is whether or not the Council will support us from a procedural point of view. We have had a first reading in the Council, this is our first reading, and we should very much like to conclude matters on the basis of this first reading. In other words, we hope that the Council’s second reading that takes place on 20 July will take up our first reading, if not we shall have to proceed to a second reading. I do not believe that it would be in the Council’s interest - and it is a pity that they are not present this evening - to do this. What is more, I should like to stress another important point in that if we proceed to a second reading, in order to adhere to the strict timetables set, we should have to attend a session in August in order to vote on this SAB at second reading, which is obviously out of the question. It has always been the rule in Parliament and the other institutions that August is excluded from the timetables set. I am sure that the Council will adhere to that rule as it is in their interests, our interests and both of our interests to agree on both the procedure to adopt as well as the substance of the budget.
costep_2009-02-02_15_7	In the wake of other initiatives, we proposed to the Committee on International Trade of the European Parliament that an oral question should be raised with a debate in plenary on production and employment in the textile and clothing sector in different Member States of the European Union, because we consider this urgent and indispensable. We also proposed that this debate should include the participation of the Council and be concluded with a resolution by this Parliament; however, these proposals did not have the support of other parliamentary groups. More than a year has passed since the debate held in this Parliament on 12 December 2007. We raised the alarm at the time that, if measures were not taken in defence of production and employment in the textile and clothing sector, we would continue to be faced with the slow agony and destruction of a large part of this strategic sector. Since then, and as had happened previously, thousands of jobs have been lost and innumerable companies closed, with 350 000 jobs and 5% of companies having vanished in the last two years alone. Is that what the European Commission claims to be competing through restructuring, we would ask. Since then, and as was the case previously, workers have continued to be faced with unemployment - all too often without payment of the compensation or back pay due to them - with intensified exploitation, with more insecurity, with late payment of wages and with deregulated working hours. Certain causes and people are responsible for this situation, such as those who promote the liberalisation of the textile and clothing trade and the relocation of production with a view to maximum profits, thus pitting a large part of the sector against competition based on double standards defined from the start. Faced with this situation, the European Union has either turned a deaf ear or taken mitigated measures which far from provide an answer to the problems and needs of the sector. The European Commission does not consider the textile and clothing industry to be special, as it claims to, unlike other sectors. Together with urgent measures which need to be implemented by each Member State, the European Union also has a duty to provide a response to the grave problems with which the sector is contending. Commissioner, when will binding rules on attaching labels of origin be applied, with the adoption, for example, of the 'made in' regulation? When will the same consumer safety and protection requirements be applied to imported products as are demanded for products made in the European Union? How will the European Union continue to monitor in real time import trends and customs inspection and control, keeping the sector fully informed and invoking safeguard clauses wherever necessary? How will it use the 2007-2013 financial framework, including the so-called Globalisation Adjustment Fund, to uphold production and employment in the textile and clothing sector, in particular in the small and medium-sized enterprises affected by liberalisation? When will there be a monetary and foreign exchange policy that does not penalise the exports of certain Member States? When will the Community programme, proposed by this Parliament, be created, and the financial resources to modernise and promote the sector and the diversification of industrial activity be unblocked, particularly those directed at the least favoured regions which are dependent on it?
costep_2011-06-06_19_29	Madam President, the CETA agreement marks an extremely important step towards a fruitful future for both the European Union and Canada. I support this project and am very pleased with the progress made so far. I think that we are on the right path to concluding the negotiations this year. However, I should point out that there are two points among the several being debated which need to be resolved to avoid creating problems at the time of ratification by some Member States, if they remain unresolved. These are the oil extractions from bituminous shale, which may pose a hazard to the environment and the local communities in the area, as well as the lack of reciprocity in the case of compulsory visa requirements for Bulgarian, Romanian and Czech citizens.
costep_2010-06-15_8_187	I welcome the recitals of this report, which make the Internet a global public good that must be governed in the common interest. The report highlights the importance of the Internet in political debate. It is for the sake of these aptly mentioned principles that I voted against this text. Indeed, how can we advocate respect for the common interest, on the one hand, and call for shared public-private governance that does not hinder free competition, on the other? Although this text has the virtue of pointing out the importance of the general interest, it achieves the opposite result. Euro-liberal dogmatism spells disaster for Europe.
costep_2000-11-15_6_11	Mr President, I would like to echo the sentiments of those who have congratulated Michel Rocard on this excellent initiative, which is in the best tradition of Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. The report is based on the intention expressed by the Council in 1992 to achieve convergence of objectives and policies in the sphere of social security, and it links these with the existing objectives announced in Lisbon with regard to social cohesion and economic progress. I think the connection between these two elements is a very sound one. I expressly included a third element in my contribution in the committee, which I believe makes another strong case for European action in the field of health insurance; in particular, the removal of obstacles to freedom of movement, and not just the free movement of services that Bartho Pronk talked about, but also the free movement of persons within the EU. In particular, these sentiments are to be found in recital J and Paragraphs 11 e) and f) and 14 of this report. Many sometimes distressing problems and examples from real life prompted me to table these amendments. I am delighted that the rapporteur and the committee have adopted them. It is not by chance that I am particularly used to facing such problems by virtue of my Dutch background. We have a special combination of private, public, individual and collective types of health insurance system, which have undergone quite some upheaval in recent times. Leaving aside for the moment the question as to whether these changes were for the better, one thing is for sure: far too little attention was given to the effects of these changes on cross-border workers, retired Dutch nationals living abroad, and for example, Germans and Belgians working in the Netherlands. In terms of European coordination, the current combination of fiscally financed national insurance for nationals, compulsory insurance for employees up to a certain income level and, in addition, private insurance with collective or individual regimes, is a downright disaster. The national insurance system is not subject to the coordination rules because it is not employees' insurance and only applies to nationals. The private system has to do with the directives for the insurance sector in the sphere of competition. There is at present an on-going discussion in the Netherlands about structural changes to the system. An opinion is being prepared on this in the Social and Economic Council. It looks as if employers and employees are at last to reach agreement on basic health insurance in which market forces and competition between insurers will be combined with agreements on a compulsory basic package and, in addition, a broad package with optional elements which must, at the very least, be subject to an acceptance obligation and an average premium. This is with a view to avoiding risk selection and exclusion, and to secure optimum accessibility for everyone. Fortunately, the parties in the SER have realised that creating such a hybrid mixture of private and public elements might run up against conflicting legislation from Brussels. People have been doing some fact-finding on this ahead of time, and have reached the sensible conclusion that, whatever happens, the entire system must now fall within the scope of the social insurance system. Coordination at European level would certainly make this a whole lot simpler for those who live and work over the border. I believe this fits in with the convergence strategy that the rapporteur has in mind. I also feel that the increase in labour mobility in Europe is necessary and lends weight to our argument in favour of producing the aforementioned Green Paper and measures on the cost of public health.
costep_1999-11-17_4_15	Mr President, Mrs Haug’s report on the European Union’s system of own resources seems rather contradictory to us, and that is why we are opposed to it. On the one hand, it declares excellent principles of economy, particularly the idea that the Union’s own resources must be limited to 1.27% of the GNPs of the Member States, a ceiling which the Commission proposal rightly sought to circumvent surreptitiously. This position is perhaps due to the rapporteur’s German nationality and the special situation of Germany but, in any case, she is right on this point and we support her on this. On the other hand, however, the self-same rapporteur contradicts her own desire for economy by calling, on the lines of the Berlin Council of March 1999, for the creation of new autonomous own resources, i.e. to put it plainly, European taxes. I recall that the Pasqua-de Villiers list, on which I stood as a candidate, deplored the Berlin conclusions during the election campaign, but that our rivals managed to cover it up. Thus, according to the Berlin Council, and today according to the Haug report, the resources of the European budget should henceforth be made up totally or partially not of State contributions but of direct taxes levied on citizens. At the same time, we must expect the power of decision regarding these taxes to be passed quickly from the Council to the European Parliament. This development would be in contradiction to our vision of a Union which is an association of states, to which the Members freely pay annual contributions. But this is not just a matter of institutional philosophy, it is a practical matter, too. Every year we are witness to confrontation over the budget because the Council seeks to resist the extravagant overbidding of the Commission, often with the support of Parliament. If we create a European tax, the Council will gradually lose its capacity to resist, and we shall be giving the crucial advantage to those institutions which push to increase the budget. I must therefore appeal to our German friends. Please understand that, in arguing in favour of a European tax, in the long term you are betraying that very desire for economy which you defend so ferociously in the short term. And since I heard it said in the debate, by Mr Bourlanges, that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference was to decide upon the creation of a European tax, I would say, on the other hand, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, that if the IGC is to discuss this matter, it must decide upon the creation of a system that is clear, transparent, fair and, above all, closely supervised by national democracies, by which I mean an annual contribution from Member States based on a percentage of their GNP, which is identical for all Member States.
costep_2009-04-01_15_18	Thank you, Mr President. I support the changes proposed by the committee responsible to the Commission’s proposal on energy efficiency and investment in renewable energy in housing. The committee’s proposal will encourage a growth in demand and a faster flow of money into measures to increase energy efficiency. Member States are now being given opportunities to direct these resources so as to achieve the maximum effect in increasing energy efficiency. The most comprehensive results would be produced by use of these resources on objectives that would give free rein to consumers' initiatives to increase energy efficiency, and the most encouraging measures would be those that reduce the risks for those who are themselves thinking about investments in energy efficiency. I concede that the committee ought, however, to give some guidelines on this matter for further activity by the Member States. Such an approach would not only have a multiplier effect for the stimulation of the economy, but would also foster more rapid dissemination of an understanding of energy saving in the Member States. The amount of resources available will, however, require the Member States to restrict the number of recipients of assistance, and in that sense it would be sensible to be guided by the Commission’s proposal, by directing these resources, first of all, to lower-income households. Thank you.
costep_2001-10-02_3_25	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the dramatic events in New York have, it seems to me, made us free to discuss certain subjects which have, until now, been taboo. Those who claimed to forbid any value judgments on civilisations are suddenly waging war on Islam. Others, who rejected any criticism of immigration, are suddenly seeing a potential terrorist in every foreigner. I can tell you straight away that this is not the position of the group of right-wing Europeans. Immigration is a phenomenon on a scale such that it cannot be seen on the same level as acts of terrorism, on which immigrants do not in any case have a monopoly. It is not the immigrants who are guilty, it is those who bring them here for economic reasons, and it may perhaps surprise you to learn that, on this point, I agree in part with what our colleague, Mr Sylla, has just said. It is also those who let themselves sink into a policy of fait accompli, and Mr Pirker’s recitals - I am thinking of recitals M and N - alas give us an example of this, alongside making some positive points. I note in particular, for example, that Paragraph 13 of the report, takes the view that the various historical, economic and social features in the individual Member States make it impossible to lay down a uniform requirement in labour from third countries which would cover the entire territory of the Union and that, furthermore, the Union has no powers in law in this field. So, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why are conclusions not drawn from this Paragraph 13? And why not restore sovereignty to the Member States in this regard and with it the legitimate right to protect our borders? After all, the dramatic events which we have witnessed have quite clearly shown that protecting borders was key to security, because this is what the government of the United States immediately did when it found itself in an emergency situation. Finally, I will close by saying that immigration should not be seen as a solution to the falling population which we are seeing in Europe. If the people of Europe abandon to others their duty to give life to new generations, they also abandon their right to live as free nations on the territory of their ancestors. We do not accept this. Applause from the right
costep_2000-02-17_7_4	Mr President, last week, in the Andalusian town of El Ejido, we saw scenes which were inappropriate to the European Union in the year 2000. This was acknowledged by the Commission President, Romano Prodi, on 9 February when he confirmed that what had occurred in El Ejido went against the very principles of the European Union. These events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism, xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated. It is incomprehensible that ways of coexisting and ensuring mutual respect cannot be found between two communities which are mutually beneficial. The only way to prevent these events happening again, in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers, is through social integration. This requires a firm economic, political and social commitment from the competent authorities. We are all immigrants. For generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly migrated. Geographical mobility is not an invention of the twentieth century and neither are its economic and work-related causes. We are all immigrants, if not ourselves personally, then through one of our relations or ancestors. However, instead of producing these events which we are condemning, migration must generate social, cultural and economic enrichment. What happened in El Ejido is unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the European Union. We must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of El Ejido against immigrant workers in the area. A whole community should not have been held responsible, criminalised and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident. Secondly, all the authorities must act immediately. Coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism. In particular, local authorities and mayors have a direct responsibility to prevent any demonstration of racism or xenophobia, especially when this involves violent and aggressive acts against people and their property. These authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these, as has happened with the mayor in question. Thirdly, the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials. They must prevent any individual action or declaration which is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the European Union. Finally, the European Union must be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles. It must prevent any racist or xenophobic demonstrations in its territory and support and collaborate with national, regional and local authorities and non-governmental organisations and associations in the application of these principles. This must occur within a framework of constant action to combat racism and xenophobia and to encourage the integration of all immigrants resident in the EU.
costep_2000-05-16_11_14	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Savary report follows the rationale of sustainable development. As we consider interoperability to be essential, we support this report, and offer our congratulations to Mr Savary for the pertinence of his observations. The road-rail balance must be adjusted by means of a carefully calculated interoperability. In the long term, the increase in heavy goods transport will cause enormous problems, such as congestion, the construction of new routes, and problems of safety and pollution. It is absolutely essential, in this eventuality, to have recourse to rail transport. The problem is even greater for countries located at strategic crossroads, such as France, where the saturation of the road networks is yet another argument for the crucial need to put interoperability into practice. The models of Thalys and Eurostar must be extended and intensified with the new high-speed train routes: TGV-East to Germany, Southern Europe-Atlantic to Madrid and Lisbon, and South-Mediterranean to Barcelona. As for conventional rail networks, it is time that interoperability was made compulsory, reinforced by considerable amounts of European aid which would, moreover, enable Member States to safeguard their conventional local networks. Interoperability is all the more necessary as rail transport is profitable over long distances. So border stops, changes in equipment and staff and, more importantly, transhipment operations should be limited to avoid putting a strain on reliability in terms of the time and service provided. Airfreight manages perfectly well without border stops. So let us adapt. We shall not be able to upgrade the competitiveness of rail unless we bring in stringent constraints. Interoperability must be made compulsory, particularly for the new networks that are being built, even if the TSIs have not been finalised. We cannot afford to delay any longer before actually implementing this measure which will acquire even greater significance with the enlargement of our Community.
costep_2008-01-16_15_44	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their comprehensive and well-structured reports, and I would like to talk briefly about one aspect. In Georgia we have had the elections, confirmed as regular by the OSCE but challenged by Russia, in which outgoing President Saakashvili was re-elected. Amid countless difficulties he attempted to bring democracy to the country, dismantling the old post-Soviet diplomacy and opening up to the West, NATO and the EU. It was this opening up that caused the retaliation by Putin’s Russia, which, amongst other things, has always favoured the independence movements in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Apart from the geopolitical situation, however, another cause of friction with Russia is, objectively, the oil and gas pipelines in Georgian territory, designed to carry Azerbaijan’s oil and gas westwards. I believe that in the Caucasus region which, as we should bear in mind, is affected by the insidious war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Chechen issue, the conflict between Turkey and Armenia and many other problems, having a democratic country which is our ally and, above all, offers an alternative energy source to Moscow, is a factor of strategic importance. We should therefore take concrete steps to strengthen this synergy.
costep_2001-03-13_11_39	Mr President, the Frahm report - I am saying this for the benefit of those who are listening to me now and did not take part in the vote - concerns the requirement to obtain a visa for those who come to Europe and who move around within our territory but are not citizens of our Member States. I voted against this initiative of the Portuguese Republic as well, because, in effect, it was not acceptable. However, I do wonder why the relevant committee did not amend the proposal to make it acceptable to Parliament. It is, in fact, important to regulate well and uniformly the movements within the European territory of citizens who enter Europe on temporary visas. Nassauer Report A5-0065/2001
costep_2006-10-23_17_17	Mr President, migrant women as a group, vulnerable though it is, are not so much a problem as an opportunity. They are vulnerable because they may be exposed to discrimination, not only for being women, but also on the basis of their being Muslim, Somali or Moroccan. They are also vulnerable to domestic violence, or because they do not speak the local language, or are financially dependent on their spouses or fathers. We must therefore support them by not letting domestic violence and honour crimes go unpunished, but that cannot be done by imposing stricter rules alone. Rights on paper are not sufficient for women; they must also be able to assert them in practice, because a woman who is dependent on the perpetrator of domestic violence will, in practice, not benefit a great deal from her rights on paper. That is why we must promote the financial independence of migrant women by, for example, counteracting discrimination within the labour market. The economy benefits when more migrant women participate in the labour market. Another opportunity we cannot afford to miss is the positive impact migrant women can have on the integration of their children in the new society. That is why, as a host community, we must be open to support of, and contact with, migrant women, for they, too, belong here. I am pleased that Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou deals with these aspects at great length in her excellent report, and I should therefore like to thank her for it.
costep_2001-10-03_7_8	Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work she has done and also the Commission on such an appropriate initiative. Nevertheless, I would like to highlight three aspects which seem to me very important. The first is the importance of the audiovisual sector in promoting sport. We must not forget that sport contributes to forging an identity and bringing people together, as well as uniting sportspeople and spectators by offering the latter the opportunity to identify with their nation. Furthermore, sport is one of the fields of activity which most affects and touches on the citizens of the European Union regardless of their age or social origin, and therefore sport cannot and must not be discriminatory and all the citizens of the European Union must be able to see sporting events. They must not be a privilege for the few, since these events are of great importance to our society. The second issue is the need to control advertising slots, and I therefore fully support the rapporteur when she backs the Commission’s strategy of carrying out a study on the repercussions of television advertising and TV shopping techniques on minors. And the third issue I would like to highlight is my total support for the rapporteur’s request that the Member States strengthen dialogue and cooperation on all issues relating to the protection of minors and young people. We cannot aspire to a world without violence when our future adults spend the day watching increasingly violent animated cartoons, films and news items.
costep_2004-02-26_1_87	Four years ago the Fifteen promised in Lisbon to make the European economy the most dynamic and the most competitive in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth together with a quantitative and qualitative improvement in employment and greater cohesion. European jargon can be used to paint a glowing picture of a brighter future but it cannot hide the hard truth. The Lisbon strategy was nothing but a barrage of attacks on employees. The European Union has shown itself to be incapable of preventing stock market redundancies, social plans and the closure of undertakings. It is even more scandalous that public money was used to inflate shareholders’ dividends, for example at STMicroelectronics. The European Union has never found ways of combating rogue managers, such as those at ParmalatOn the contrary, the EU continues to protect tax havens and banking secrecy. Lisbon, though, is primarily about structural reforms of the labour market based on flexibility, precariousness and salary reduction. Finally, it is about the commercialisation of public services to the detriment of citizens. This is why the 2004 Spring European Summit must make a radical break with the Lisbon process. Since the joint resolution refused to do this, I voted against it. Report: Randzio-Plath A5-0045/2004
costep_1998-01-16_5_14	Madam President, Mr Commissioner, I am very pleased that this debate is being held, during the plenary session, and that it is part of the prospective review of the structural policy of the CAP, as it seems particularly important to me that we should discuss, within these walls, the way in which the European Union can, alongside the Member States, contribute by means of a controlled policy towards the protection of ecologically sensitive areas of agricultural production. In fact, if we are content to allow only the pressures of the world market to have effect, it is difficult to see how active, responsible agricultural activities can be maintained in areas with specific constraints, caused by the common characteristics of the various areas, relating to their soil, climate, the special sensitivity of their ecosystems or waterways, their remoteness or problems of accessibility. Preventing at all costs the desertification of these areas, preventing their gradual depopulation, by enabling sufficiently profitable and enduring agricultural activities to be maintained and by supporting the development of non aggressive tourism - are these not the dual aims which a policy relating to such areas should pursue, in order to maintain a good balance with regard to the powerful constraints of development? Rather than questioning the actual provisions of a policy in favour of mountain regions, future reforms should on the contrary consider them as a good initial basis to be refined and complemented in order to go beyond the stage of occasional, experimental action, and to set up, within the framework of the revised Objective 2, a real permanent programme, which is predictable, and therefore stimulating, which will in particular attract young workers. I am extremely pleased in this respect with Commissioner Ortega’s remarks that, as wetlands are also ecologically sensitive areas in which this House is particularly interested, they should, like mountain regions, be given more specific support within the framework of the reform of the structural policy.
costep_1998-04-02_4_15	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Schaffner on her report, which has proved to be moderate in its approach to free movement. It is full of good intentions. Moreover, there lies within it the desire to strengthen external border controls, implement new means of redress for individuals who encounter problems when exercising their rights, modernize social security rights and encourage language training and cultural exchanges. This we can be proud of. However, this should not prevent us from criticizing certain unacceptable points. Mrs Schaffner is effectively proposing to narrow the range of public office posts reserved for nationals and thereby, it seems to me, relax public office access criteria. Under no circumstances can we allow a situation in which public office might be threatened where national preference still prevails. In France, as in nearly all the other European countries, public office is reserved for nationals, and that is how it should remain. The report also proposes a more flexible interpretation of the rules governing family reunification. As far as I am concerned, I have always defended the notion of family because I believe it is the guarantee of our nations' survival. However, the notion of family reunification cannot be extended infinitely, and it absolutely must not be used as a pretext for opening the flood gates to a wave of new immigrants into a Member State - immigrants who, to meet the entry criteria, merely have to claim to have a distant relative already resident within the territory. The report also proposes improving the situation of third-country citizens resident in a Member State. But is it not the case that everything is already in place to accept them and absorb them into the adoptive country? In France, foreigners legally established within the territory enjoy the same rights, the same privileges, as any French person born in the country. Should they expect more? We do not believe so, for that would be discriminatory. Finally, this report sets out to favour the free movement of citizens of the Member States of Europe. All well and good. However, we must not miss the wood for the trees. It has been clearly demonstrated that the Schengen Agreement cannot yet be applied to the letter because of the catastrophic consequences it has for the security of the Member States. Removing internal border controls and replacing them with hypothetical common external borders means the free movement, trade and consumption of drugs, illegal immigration, insecurity and international crime, all of which continues to escalate. We must look at the evidence: regrettably, the uniform conditions necessary for a European space without borders - conditions of national security, full employment and social calm - are not yet in place. So yes, as it says in Mrs Schaffner’s report, we do propose to strengthen border controls but, ladies and gentlemen, this must be counterbalanced by a coherent, dissuasive and harmonized immigration policy, increased cooperation between the police forces and the courts, and harmonization of the methods for acquiring nationality which must be based on affiliation and a restrictive policy on family reunification.
costep_2011-06-08_7_218	A progressive agreement will encourage and accelerate active trade and investment relations between the EU and Canada. The liberalisation of trade relations will bring mutual benefits for business actors and will create more favourable investment conditions. To achieve a comprehensive, high-quality agreement that goes beyond the WTO commitments, neither party should express requirements that conflict with their internal policies or institutional arrangements. Furthermore, in the event of commercial disputes, the reciprocity principle should be applied, the protection of intellectual property rights should be improved and there should be reciprocal access to the services and public procurement markets. Particular attention should be paid to the agricultural sector and consumers. We must maintain a firm stance on GMOs, milk and origin labelling. We must ensure fair and greater competition among agricultural goods suppliers. I feel that the Commission should begin negotiations with Canada on investment once Parliament has expressed its position on the future EU investment policy. We must protect the parties' most sensitive sectors, so that they are excluded from the scope of investment agreements. The Commission must take a firm stance on the ban on seal products and, in this regard, Canada should withdraw its requirement for the WTO to establish a formal dispute resolution panel. Such a requirement does not conform with the principles of positive trade relations.
costep_2005-06-06_1_122	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rural development policy is the most innovative element of the Community’s new agricultural policy, and it is crucial that the EU budget does not sacrifice this most ambitious of challenges for the future of our rural areas. Cutting the funds allocated to rural development means taking away resources from food safety, environmental protection, measures to enhance the countryside, product quality and job creation. The report endorsed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development attaches great importance to support measures for young farmers, who should be encouraged to remain in the countryside and to farm in a competitive and sustainable manner. Mrs Schierhuber’s efforts to maintain funding for rural development are commendable, but reducing the minimum percentages of expenditure on three axes causes misgivings. It would have been more appropriate to keep the Commission’s proposal; lowering the rates means allowing Member States more discretion in their management of resources, and consequently a weaker and less incisive EU policy. In addition, with regard to the LEADER programme, the Commission’s proposal establishing a reserve fund for countries with lower spending levels, in order to enhance and reward the best projects, should be kept. It is crucial, moreover, that the national action plans should be consistent with the Community’s strategic objectives, and the strengthening of partnerships is an essential tool in fulfilling these objectives. Finally, in order to transform rural development into a genuine territorial policy, the policy must be consistent with, and integrated with, all of the other Community policies. It involves fundamental elements of the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategy, which we cannot abandon if we hope to revive Europe, its objectives and its values.
costep_2010-03-24_16_30	Taking into account the complicated economic situation in the Member States, next year’s budget should be planned very thoroughly. Job retention and creation should receive most attention. Support for and the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises would be of service here, since these companies employ a large proportion of European Union citizens. Financial support measures must be provided in a more flexible manner and must be more accessible if newly established companies or those that have experienced financial difficulties are to survive. We also should not forget areas providing added value, not just to individual Member States, but to the Community as a whole. Amongst these areas, we could mention transport, the priority of which should be the creation of a sustainable and safe transport system and the development of trans-European networks. Suitable funding for energy link projects, ensuring energy independence, must also remain one of the priorities of the 2011 budget.
costep_2009-01-13_9_19	As the European Parliament’s rapporteur for the legislative report on the expansion of the European Aviation Safety Agency’s (EASA) powers, I welcome the negotiated agreement with the United States on facilitating mutual acceptance of civil aviation safety certificates. This agreement marks an important step in expanding transatlantic cooperation, which is a priority objective of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. It establishes sound conditions for boosting trade in goods and services in the civil aviation sector between the European Union and the United States, which undoubtedly benefits Europe. The agreement offers enhanced guarantees as regards safety and reinforcement of the compatibility of products, components and aircraft with the increased demands of protecting the environment. In these conditions, we can hope that the European Single Sky principles will be extended in the future to apply to transatlantic cooperation and that cooperation will be widened in the field of research, as well as the implementation of new technologies in this field, based on collaboration between SESAR and NextGen. I believe that this agreement will facilitate in the long term the mutually beneficial extension of the cooperation framework between the EASA and the FAA, from which airlines, the aviation industry and, more significantly, passengers will directly benefit.
costep_2006-11-15_8_7	I voted for the Joan i Mari report on a new framework strategy for multilingualism, although I have some reservations as regards some proposals and amendments that have been adopted. I feel that the European multilingualism strategy should cover the teaching and promotion of 'European world languages', a term that applies to Portuguese, which is the third most widely spoken EU language in the world (behind English and Spanish, and ahead of German, French and Italian). Owing to its uniqueness and to the fact that it is spoken by some 200 million people in eight countries spread over five continents, the Portuguese language should be one of the EU official languages. The report fails to acknowledge this, as it ought to. Portuguese is the most durable link between the continents, as it is a means of communication, the raw material used by great poets and writers, and has a dignity born of eight hundred years of history.
costep_2000-06-15_6_3	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just had a chance to speak with some young lawyers from Serbia, who gave us an impressive account of the hopeless situation in their country. So I am glad to come back to today’s subject, the complete lack of press freedom and access to information there. The population only gets information from the subjective viewpoint of Mr Milosevic and his wife Mrs Markovic. Anyone who sees the facts as they are is treated as a traitor to the Serbian people and a NATO lackey. One of the young Serbian women told me that it is extraordinarily difficult for her to explain to her grandmother why she opposes Milosevic, as her grandmother only has her own information and experiences to go by. This means that she cannot understand why this young woman is involved in the OTPOR organisation. We must help the independent democratic media in Serbia so that they can provide accurate information as far as possible, and so that democracy may yet blossom in Serbia. I would also like to say, however, that we naturally expect the opposition press"", or what remains of it, to denounce the current irregularities in political leadership in the city of Belgrade, for example, which is governed by the MRS, just as much as it justifiably criticises the Milosevic regime. As long as it does not do this and is blind to other shortcomings, it is not an independent medium. I would also like to draw honourable Members attention to the following point: given that we are now hearing suggestions that Mr Draskovic is once again on the way to collaborating with Mr Milosevic, we have to be very careful about who we give help to. OTPOR, the real resistance group in Serbia, which grew out of the student movement, is as at present being prevented by Milosevic from registering as an organisation. Nevertheless, this will not stop it organising demonstrations and displays of good will on the streets of Belgrade and elsewhere in Serbia. Next weekend, our delegation will be travelling to Montenegro, and on Sunday will be holding talks with representatives of OTPOR and of the opposition. We will, of course, take this opportunity to sound out what scope there is for supporting them. A contributory factor to the lack of freedom in that country is the Serbian University Law promulgated in October 1998, since when many professors have been removed from their posts. They are forbidden to give lectures and they have been removed from their posts because of allegedly inadequate qualifications. It is evident what is going on if I tell you that one of these allegedly unqualified professors is now a professor at the Universities of Saarbrücken and Berlin. I find it hard to imagine that these universities would employ unqualified Serbian professors. But, of course, they did not fit in with Milosevic’s doctrines. On the other hand, I have to tell you - because we here do not get to know everything that you can only find out by talking with people on the spot - that the extremist nationalist politician Selesj is currently a university professor in the law faculty. You can imagine how they rate quality there! Today’s debate is, of course, first and foremost concerned with conditions in Serbian prisons. There are over 2 000 Kosovo Albanians held in Serbian prisons, most of them since spring 1999, that is before the NATO offensive. The situation in these prisons is indescribable. The people have received no legal representation. If they are then sentenced, this happens with total disregard for the law. Let me remind you about Flora Brovina, the doctor who did nothing more than respect her professional ethics as a doctor, by helping people regardless of their nationality. She was sentenced to 14 years in prison in Serbia, in Nis. The prisons are certainly not in line with any convention, and contravene the Geneva Convention. There is horrifying torture and abuse, and the world is simply looking on. A fortnight ago, I visited Kosovo with 12 colleagues, and that was when Kosovo Albanians gave us these 75 000 signatures. We have brought them here because we want to demonstrate the enormity and the awfulness of the situation of people who have been trying to find out for at least one and a half years where their relatives are - their fathers, their brothers or even their children. I do not think that we can simply file these 75 000 signatures away. We must attempt to at least give these people some certainty about where these missing persons are, what prisons they are in or where they met their death. That is the picture in Serbia. In Kosovo, which we also visited, although the situation is different, there are similar problems. We went to Kosovo last year because we wanted to help the Kosovo Albanians who for ten years have suffered under an apartheid-like regime to obtain attention. The aim we are working towards now in Kosovo is to achieve peaceful coexistence between the majority Albanian population and minorities who are also entitled to live there, be they Serbs, Ashkali or Roma. I believe that we should focus our attention on ensuring that coexistence is possible there. There were many incidents during the last few days of our visit there, and these are occurring again now. There have been murders of Serbs over the last few days. Nobody can say who committed them, but someone is responsible for the fact that a Serb - or even several Serbs - is murdered somewhere every day. We condemn these acts, indeed we condemned them on the spot, and have done so here on several occasions. We call on everyone in positions of responsibility, and now above all Kosovo Albanians, to ensure that when the occasion arises their compatriots behave in a restrained manner and prevent this sort of conduct against minorities. We did not come to the aid of the Kosovo Albanians so that they could make the life of minorities in Kosovo hell. It also has to be said, because we do not know who the culprits are, that it cannot, of course, be ruled out some of the people responsible for these acts are possibly being infiltrated into Kosovo from Serbia as agents provocateurs, because they simply do not want peace in Kosovo. All of us in the European Union, and also UNMIK, must take swift action in that region now. UNMIK must ensure that there is a legal framework, so that the culprits can be caught, put behind bars and punished. But in Kosovo there is also the problem of missing Serbs, which we are all familiar with. We call on the Kosovo Albanians to speak now and to inform the Red Cross if they know anything about the whereabouts of these Serbs and people of other nationalities, so as to put an end to this uncertainty. The few Serbs in Kosovo who want to work with the administration of course also have a problem. They are viewed as traitors by some of their own compatriots. That being the case, we must help these well intentioned Serbs to achieve some positive results, so that their cooperation is clearly of some benefit for the Serbian population. We must try to ensure greater police protection. That is why I appeal to all the Member States to send as many police officers as possible to Kosovo, in order to guarantee protection for minorities also.
costep_2003-05-13_2_107	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 7 May, a Commissioner who is not present in the House today - and I regret that because, for once, I would have liked to congratulate a Commissioner - said: as regards the prevention of animal epidemics we have developed a cutting-edge system, creating a Committee of Veterinary Experts which lays down the law for every Member State, whereas, when it comes to human health, we have no say on the matter. I reiterate, we have no say on the matter. Incidentally, thus far, the Commission has had no say on the matter in this House either. This absurd situation does, however, reflect the times in which we live. I agree with some of the points made by Mr Mussa just now, but we must bear in mind that you, Antonio, are calling - like of many of us, moreover - for structural reforms, reform of nosocomial, hospital and even scientific structures. Structural reforms need to be first adopted by vote, desired and then implemented; then come the bribes and all the rest of it. In any case, we must have guidelines. Today, however, there is an aspect which, as far as our area is concerned, is related to trade privileges, which sometimes play the role here which political and system interests play in the communist states, in the totalitarian - let us call them communist - states. (There are some minor fascist, nazi variations but the essence is the same). In actual fact, we have a situation of impending rampant zoonosis: in other words, diseases can be transmitted from animal to human being. Public health in Europe - here in our own countries - is under ever-increasing, extremely serious threat, for the world is becoming increasingly globalised and there are an increasing number of densely populated areas. Now, and I quote, Europe has been suffering for many months from orthomyxovirus strains causing - I repeat, which are currently causing, in other words this is happening right now, President-in-Office of the Council - extremely dangerous centres of avian influenza. Here in Europe, there are currently a number of extremely dangerous centres of avian influenza, the danger of which is often played down. Why is that? So as not to block the huge flows of foodstuffs exports. The introduction of a vaccination would, of course, affect the export of these foodstuffs. We therefore chose to stamp out the disease instead, culling entire farm herds - 25 million head were destroyed in Holland and Belgium alone! It is true that these animals cost us a dollar a day - money which we do not give the world or even our unemployed in some cases - but it is also true that the culling is subsidised. We are therefore in a situation where we lack specific knowledge - even after some, after many years, I am still not at all sure what the difference is between HIV and AIDS. All we can say is that infection experts fear an explosion in the autumn over and above the usual seasonal variation. I would point out that 600 000 died in Italy from Spanish influenza alone - as many as in a major world war. Take heed! This is not Europe - it is an absence of Europe.
costep_2009-03-23_14_25	Mr President, Mr Kohout, Mrs Ashton, I have listened to what you have said. Mr Kohout, you spoke about economic sustainability. The question I am asking myself today is what that means, apart from words. Indeed, what does that mean at a time of economic, financial and environmental crisis? What guarantees can we give? Despite the reassuring words of the Commissioner, I am asking whether, since these agreements were discussed in another world, is the project we are proposing to our African, Caribbean and Pacific partners actually still appropriate in the current situation? Personally, I do not think so. We meet with NGOs, we meet with SMEs. We were in Guyana recently where the president said to us: you are asking us to diversify, but tell us what goods can our small country produce that can compete with Brazil or Venezuela? Today, therefore, I think that we must not close our eyes. You speak on the one hand about flexibility and on the other about WTO rules. I am sorry but the two terms are absolutely contradictory, because they would require restructuring and we know very well that restructuring causes greater poverty in these countries. I do not think, therefore, that what we are proposing today and what we proposed in the past are at all appropriate. Have we looked at the results of the development model that we have set up over the last 40 years? It is a failure and I think that has been said already. This failure then, I think, will now continue; the situation will get worse with these partnership agreements because they are absolutely not appropriate to the global economic, social and environmental situation.
costep_2007-12-12_13_23	Many thanks to the rapporteur, who had the honour, in this report, of introducing a new and at the same time old European country. After the 'velvet divorce' from Serbia, Montenegro has been given the opportunity to demonstrate the unlimited potential of a small, proud country. On the other hand, Montenegro should lead in the development of regional cooperation, continuing to increase the rights of minorities and contributing to the conversion of the Balkan region from a barrel of gunpowder to a garden of nations. Like the other countries whose names have only recently appeared on the map, Montenegro is facing a number of hazardous challenges: deep-rooted corruption, illegal business, the black economy, etc. It is unfortunate that some foreign investors, especially those from Russia, are attracted to this young country mainly because it offers easy ways of striking illegal financial deals. The decision not to hand over the US workers to the International Criminal Court in exchange for military assistance undermines Montenegro’s credibility as regards its willingness to cooperate peacefully with its neighbours, and even its dedication to European objectives. Today, from the shadows of the past, Montenegro, like some of its neighbouring countries, is attracted to the prospect of becoming a member of the European Union. The very perspective of becoming a Member State encourages the development of democracy, human rights and a better life for citizens. The implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement should put the wind of Europe in the sails of Montenegro’s reforms. The country can draw from the experience accumulated en route to achieving EU membership by their neighbour Slovenia and other countries that joined the EU in the new Millennium. Montenegro’s initiative of declaring itself an ecological republic is laudable; however, the path to achieving credible implementation could be a long one. It is good, that the curtain of isolation surrounding visas for Montenegro and other Balkan countries has been ripped up. The European Commission and the Council should not linger at the halfway stage, but continue to demolish this obstruction, together with financial and bureaucratic barriers, while maintaining a strong level of protection against criminals and lawbreakers.
costep_2011-06-09_9_6	Mr President, I should like to emphasise how at the bilateral summit, taking place today and tomorrow, there will be an important issue to confront; an issue, however, that seems to me to be missing from our joint resolution. In other words, I think that this summit could risk being overshadowed by a split on the prohibition of vegetable imports from Europe due to the E coli bacterium. Like the Commission earlier, I find it absurd that Russia should place an embargo on products that we consume every day and on which we carry out thorough checks. I think Russia’s reaction is more of a political move, like many we have already seen in the past. I believe that my thoughts on this matter, including in my capacity as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, will be shared by fellow Members. I therefore think it would be a good idea to tackle this problem at the summit as well, including asking Russia to lift this disproportionate and unjustified import ban on European Union vegetables immediately, which, as such, is out of line with the principles established by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), especially considering that Russia is a candidate for accession to the WTO. Mr Putin, the Russian Prime Minister, has already announced that Russia will not lift the ban until the European Union has provided details on the source of the E coli infection.
costep_2011-06-22_16_5	Mr President, we have had countless trialogue meetings, some late at night, with other Members, the Commission and the Hungarian Presidency. I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Members and our counterparts for the work that we have completed together. The message from the Ecofin Council is that everyone needs to shoulder their responsibilities. My immediate reaction is to say: 'All right, then, let us genuinely face up to our responsibilities.' Not with a huge fanfare, not so as to be able to say that we reached an agreement rapidly, but with an eye on the financial problems in the euro area and the European Union and in an attempt to come up with some proper solutions. Certainly, that was my group’s motto in these negotiations. I doubt that the markets and our citizens would believe in speedy but superficial solutions. In our estimation, substantial improvements are needed. We have, I think, already achieved some of the objectives that we set ourselves. Let me remind you that we are not the only ones with these aims: on several occasions, the European Central Bank has called on Parliament to beef up the Commission’s already bold proposals. We have therefore firmed up the rules. That was one of our guiding principles: not for the pleasure of rule-making, but because breaking common rules in a community based on the rule of law endangers the single currency. We have introduced penalties for fraud. Unfortunately this is one of the lessons that we have had to learn from the euro’s early years. As Mrs Ford said, we have also tried to impose a degree of order on national budgetary procedures, if only so as to be able to compare practices in different countries. One point was particularly important to me: if we go to our citizens with nothing to say other than 'we have increased automaticity', as the newspapers are putting it, they will be left with the impression that some mysterious machine has been turned on in Brussels and will rap them on the knuckles whenever something goes wrong. If we want stricter rules, they need to be more intelligent, but above all we need more democratic debate and more cross-border discussions. This is why we have proposed - and I would like to thank all the Members who have supported me on this point - creating what we have termed an economic dialogue, which must be proportionate. There is no threat to national constitutions; it is simply an expression of our desire for more discussion within the euro area in particular, but also in the Europe of 27. We want this House to be the forum for that transparent dialogue between the European institutions and the Member States, and in particular a place where Member States can voice their problems and explain their positions. Some countries are lagging behind, others are further ahead, some are on the fringes, some have larger populations: we need to bear all that in mind. I am delighted to see that this week in the German media Mr Habermas has again stressed that increasing democratic legitimacy is a vital necessity. I would say to Mrs Ford that we are not arguing in favour of enhancing our powers, we are calling for a greater role for those mandated by the people to defend their interests in Brussels. There are other important points, particularly on the macroeconomic side. I believe that all Member States need to be subject to common surveillance. Symmetry is an important issue. The Council should understand what this means: intelligent symmetry that distinguishes between deficit and surplus, but symmetry all the same. Let me close by mentioning Eurosecurities, which were one of the things that I championed. I would like to make an appeal to all political group leaders: you cannot claim to support Eurosecurities but vote against them. You might argue that you want more, I myself would have liked to go further, but I do fully appreciate the efforts that Commissioner Rehn is willing to make. Let me remind you that the Commissioner himself put forward proposals in May 2010 in accordance with the Commission’s legislative initiative. We want to put those proposals back on track. We want the euro finally to take on the mantle of a world currency, we want a large and liquid market, which will reduce the cost of borrowing. We want part of that borrowing - a limited amount, of course - to be shared in the long term using a full-blown market regulatory instrument. Consequently, I hope that tomorrow’s vote will be favourable and that all those who claim to be in favour of Eurosecurities will discuss the issue in a spirit of open-mindedness rather than based on ideological prejudices.
costep_2007-04-25_12_64	Shortly after the 'Erika' and 'Prestige' oil tankers went down, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament led a campaign calling for the EU to provide itself with legislation aimed at enhancing maritime safety and at doing more to prevent accidental pollution in its territorial waters. This campaign has borne fruit, but a genuine European maritime safety area has not fully been created. This 'third maritime safety package' is a decisive step towards achieving this objective. The five reports submitted to the European Parliament contain several major advances: a clear and precise legal framework for places of refuge for ships in distress, under the aegis of an independent authority; a permanent inspection body, to make inspections easier; a high level of protection for passengers, in line with that for other modes of transport; more effective and higher quality controls in European ports, with special attention paid to 'high-risk' vessels. I shall therefore vote in favour of these reports. I hope from now on that the EU will also improve its legislation against the 'hooligans of the sea', who are responsible in the Mediterranean for 'daily oil slicks'. There are 650 000 tonnes of oil spills each year as a result of unauthorised degassing, a figure that equates to 75 'Erikas'!
costep_2003-10-23_1_114	At a time when the leaders of the ΕU, at the recent summit in Brussels, are expressing their support for the 'democratically elected government of Bolivia' and are calling on the people to refrain from acts of violence, Sanchez de Lozada has submitted his resignation as president of the country and gone to Miami to seek refuge with his friends. The popular uprising in Bolivia, which claimed dozens of victims as a result of the violent bloody repression, was an outburst by the repressed: the workers, the farmers and the natives. It was a claim on their part for a place under the sun, their decision to defend the natural wealth of their country from plundering by foreign monopolies and the neo-colonialism of the USA. Once again the people are distinguishing themselves as the protagonist of history. Once again it is being proven that the adversary, however strong he may appear, is not invincible. Although the EP resolution contains a number of correct appraisals, it takes a rather neutral position towards the popular uprising. That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote. At the same time, we express our solidarity with the people of Bolivia and the whole of Latin America and our steadfast conviction that the recent victory will not be the last.
costep_2011-04-07_7_239	Important strategic amendments were made to the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) today in the plenary debate in Strasbourg. This has shown that Europe can be proactive if it wants to be, and that it can remain united around an ideal. We have proven this once again today. I am pleased to see this, in a resolution for which I had the honour of being the rapporteur. Indeed, I was pleased to notice that Commissioner Füle welcomed almost all of our proposals, as the whole Chamber could see during the debate which preceded this vote. I now challenge the Commission to demonstrate the ambition that this moment demands in its review process on 10 May, with a neighbourhood policy that is tailor-made to each state, with clear benchmarks and careful consideration. This will allow a future Mediterranean Economic Area with the new democracies in the south, and I hope that the good atmosphere and cooperation that have marked the work on this subject will lead to the permanent involvement of Parliament in planning and evaluating this policy. I think it is absolutely vital that the EU should favour a bottom-up approach in the future for its neighbourhood policy, for the reasons outlined in this resolution.
costep_2002-12-17_2_117	Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs for the budget, Göran Färm and Per Stenmarck, for their excellent work, as well as Terence Wynn, Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, for his leadership on that committee. I also want to thank Denmark’s chairmen in the Council for their cooperation, which was excellent, and Commissioner Michaele Schreyer for her excellent input. Next year’s European Union budget is a disciplined budget. The increase in expenditure is below inflation, at just 1.9%. This represents an outstanding gesture of support by the European Parliament to help Member States balance their national budgets. It also demonstrates responsibility on the part of the EU, while Member States try to meet the requirements of its Stability and Growth Pact. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports this aim, although it partly undermines the EU’s long-term attempt to balance its economy, as the EU’s biggest budget worry this time is outstanding commitments. At present these stand at EUR 103 billion, which is to say, more than the entire budget for one year. There has been an increase in arrears of EUR 17 billion since the start of the year, with no limit to this in sight. The situation is at its most wretched in the area of structural operations, where outstanding commitments have grown over the year by EUR 13 billion. The most difficult situation, relatively speaking, however, is in the area of pre-accession aid, where EUR 8.5 billion in outstanding commitments has accrued in three years, with just under EUR 2 billion being paid out in actual aid. What is most vexing is that there would have been funds available for payment in respect of these commitments, but they were not used. Consequently, the situation betrays administrative inefficiency, with the Commission and the Member States as the guilty parties. That is why Commission reform is extremely important. At the moment the Commission is very conservative and shirks its responsibilities. We should also simplify legal instruments and procedures, as was agreed in conciliation with the Council in the summer. Enlargement is the hallmark of next year’s budget. This budget is the last to be drafted for an EU consisting of 15 Member States. Parliament safeguarded the posts needed in the Commission for enlargement by amassing resources partly out of this year’s budget. In this way we were able to meet next year’s expenditure in advance and fit administrative expenditure into the tight framework in place for heading 5. My group supports this. Otherwise, we could say of the budget’s content that the EU’s functions are adequately financed. Agricultural expenditure is under control, so there is no need for significant reforms for budgetary reasons. External actions were able to be partly financed in advance out of this year’s budget, and there was no need to look again at Parliament’s priorities. In addition to other actions, we were able to improve the financing of the Northern Dimension a little, which has to be considered a good thing.
costep_2000-11-29_8_15	Mr President, I would like to concentrate on Amendment No 1 to the Brok report, which concerns the setting up of an International Tribunal for Saddam Hussain’s reign of terror. There is no lack of reliable information on the nature of the present Iraqi regime. The flood of reports is still growing by the day. Nevertheless, the 'Republic of Fear', as Saddam’s reign of terror was appropriately dubbed many years ago, is still greatly underestimated by many western politicians, also within the European Parliament. However, this erroneous assessment could have disastrous consequences, because according to what he says, the Gulf War is far from over in Sadism Hussain’s eyes. Hence his relentless efforts to build up an arsenal of extremely sinister weapons of mass destruction. After all, who is there to prevent him from doing so? He has kept UN inspection teams out for quite some time now. Incidentally, this brutal Iraqi autocrat is advocating a massive Arab attack on the State of Israel, indeed worse still, a full-blown Jihad, a Holy War. What, in all fairness, could be more obvious than the need to firmly contain the potential threat posed by Saddam? In point of fact, how do the Council and the Commission view the situation at the present time? One would appear to be justified in fearing that there is no question of our establishing a European CFSP to deal with this crucial danger to world peace. At all events, the consequences of a failed sanctions regime against Baghdad are incalculable. Owing to misplaced pleas for the suffering of the Iraqi people - as if we really believe that Saddam lacks the financial means to alleviate this - the tyrant of the Tigris is gradually being given more room to manoeuvre on the international scene. To what end? To wreak death and destruction in his own country and beyond. In a nutshell, it is high time that the UN set up an International Tribunal to conduct a thorough investigation into, and try, all the crimes perpetrated by Saddam’s 'Republic of Fear' . An initiative to this effect would certainly lend credibility to the CFSP of the European Union. Hence our enthusiastic support for Amendment No 1 of the Brok report.
costep_2000-10-24_5_31	Mr President, as usual, I am speaking on behalf of the Members of the Bonino List, and I would like to start by echoing the congratulations to the two rapporteurs on the work they have done in recent months and, in general, congratulating the Committee on Budgets on its work. Mr President, when one hears Mr Wurtz’s ornate, well-argued and well-considered reasoning, it is difficult not to agree with at least the underlying argument, if not the method he recommends. Of course, we too are convinced that, if Parliament and the Council do not assume their responsibilities in terms of the need to deal with the budget, first and foremost tackling the use of the flexibility instrument but, also, revising the financial perspective, it will be difficult not to agree with the view that we are going to be running away from our responsibilities with a heavy conscience because we are not able to make good our undertakings, either those made in Biarritz or those which have been made with many other partners over the years. We do not agree with the method, which is why, in this first reading, we place our confidence in the rapporteur’s approach, in spite of what happened last night in the Committee on Budgets, in the hope that this will constitute a basis for effective discussion with the Council in-between the first and second readings. However, the issue raised by Mr Wurtz is clearly central. In my opinion, if we do not revise the financial perspective, we will be being irresponsible towards both ourselves and our partners, especially in the 2001-2006 period.
costep_2002-10-23_3_108	Mr President, the procedure followed in drawing up this resolution was rather strange and has presented difficulties for all of us. Clearly, the fight against terrorism currently has aspects of both internal and foreign policy, and I would not like to see the importance of the work carried out by my own committee diminished. I would therefore ask you to allow Mr Hernández Mollar to speak before I do. If this is impossible under the Rules of Procedure, I am prepared to exchange my scheduled slot with his, which I would not have thought would cause any major problems for the staff.
costep_1997-11-05_8_3	Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it would be unjust, and indeed quite untrue, to say that globalization and international movements of companies do not have negative effects. The movement of people, ideas, goods, the end of certain great totalitarian empires, the crumbling of walls and iron curtains represent real progress overall. One can even say that sometimes certain relocations give work to poor countries and by reducing the price of products consumed in rich countries they promote growth there. All the same, Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when one looks at the construction of Europe, relocation always seems to take first place amongst phenomena regarded as negative. European citizens no longer tolerate them and many, often wrongly, also blame the European Union. André Sainjon has done excellent work. He has my support and that of the socialists, just as I support, and we support, the political and union initiatives geared to the struggle against destructive ultra-liberalism. In fact, two areas need to be distinguished as regards relocations, those taking place within the Union and those taking place in the rest of the world. Of course, the first, within the Union, cannot be banned, but fiscal and social harmonization, from the top down, can, should and must be accelerated. It is impossible to accept a single market where the rules of the game, and hence the costs, remain fundamentally different. This would be disastrous for all, particularly the wage-earners, and hence for the very idea of the construction of Europe. Harmonization, certainly, but above all, and I insist on this, relocations which benefit from direct or indirect European Union aid can, should and must be banned. There are many well-known cases of this. It is intolerable and legislative measures must be taken. It is quite possible to do this, it is quite simple. All that is needed is the political will. But alongside internal relocations, there are also, of course, relocations outside the Union. André Sainjon makes some interesting proposals, which I support, in particular that of a code of conduct for European multinationals, as well as the proposal to modify the OECD investment code. Without going into detail either, we too affirm that we must fight against forced labour, against child slavery, against discrimination of all kinds, but also for the promotion of union freedom, for the generalization of collective negotiations, and as regards labour law, for a minimum code in all the countries. In conclusion, Mr President, while free movement of people, ideas and goods in Europe and in the world is an excellent thing and progress in commercial, economic and industrial does matter, free movement must be organized and regulated, excesses prevented, and a minimum of common rules established, so as not to favour exploiters of all kinds. While it is always good to grasp freedom, it must not lead to the law of the strongest. That is why we do not oppose movement, but everything that resembles the generalization of the law of the strongest.
costep_1997-12-18_4_12	Madam President, was the Kyoto Conference a success? Opinions vary. Last week in her response, Commissioner Bjerregaard seemed disappointed. The EU environment ministers were relieved with the result which was achieved. I am inclined to agree with the environment ministers, and I am pleased with the positive tone of the Commissioner’s argument, and praise her for her dedication in Kyoto. It was feared that if no one moved, there would be no agreement. The compromise which we have now is approximately the arithmetical average between the 0 % of the United States and the 15 % of the European Union. Not very elegant, but the maximum achievable and hopefully the beginning of greater things. The negotiations were difficult and complex, that much is clear. That is why it is a victory for the European Union that such clear percentages were laid down. It shows that amongst the industrial nations the start of an awareness has grown that herein lies a responsibility. I think that combatting global warming is one of the most obvious test cases of international environmental awareness. It is a major plus that even countries like the United States and Japan have now agreed to the reductions. We all know how strong the link is between economic growth and CO2 emissions. Even stabilizing of the emissions calls for strong measures. That is why it so important that all industrial nations set themselves reductions targets. The Union was blamed in the beginning for setting targets which it would not be able meet. I have to tell you that we also doubt the will to achieve this 15 % by the year 2010, yet this is necessary. In my own country latterly economic growth has been deemed more important than achieving reduction targets. In our view two things are therefore needed for the coming ten to fifteen years. Firstly, an enormous effort to employ the most effective reduction instruments. Secondly, to work towards a global awareness that things cannot go on as they are. We must aim for a new model for economic development. This is vital, based on respect for the creation and the Creator of life.
costep_2002-11-20_3_203	Madam President, I believe that in this debate we must distinguish between two things, as the representative of the Commission has said. Firstly, the genuinely exceptional circumstances in Pakistan and the strategic role it plays in relation to stability in Afghanistan, to the international coalition against terrorism and to the stability of all the countries of Central Asia. However, on the other hand, I do not believe that this fact bears any relation to the internal situation in that country, to the increase in Islamic fundamentalism, the interests and people, our allies, who are being attacked in Afghanistan and the human rights situation in the country. There are horrendous cases such as kidnap, extortion and the captivity of the so-called 'child jockeys' and, of course, I am also referring to the result of the evaluation of the elections. Mr Haarder, you know what affection and respect I have had for you since we worked together in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, but I would like to ask you what the point is in sending a mission of European Union electoral observers, the members of which behave in an exemplary manner at great risk to themselves, to carry out an assessment of the situation which furthermore is shared with other international missions, such as that of the Commonwealth and that of ANFREL, if then the representative of the President-in-Office of the Council fails to authorise it. Do we not already have enough differences in the United Nations Security Council, the General Affairs Council or at European Councils without this further demonstration of disagreement and division? I believe, Madam President, that we must take note of this attitude and work together to prevent any recurrence of this type of situation which presents an image of total fragmentation which, of course, jeopardises the image and prestige of the European Union abroad.
costep_2001-09-05_3_10	Madam President, if something characterises the production of this report on terrorism, it has not just been the rigour and know-how of the rapporteur, Mr Watson, whom I would expressly like to congratulate, but also the willingness and understanding of almost all the political groups in this House to reflect not only their rejection and condemnation of terrorism, the people involved in it and the methods it uses, but also to reach a consensus on the legal instruments which we must create at European level in order to combat and pursue the crimes involved in terrorist activity and organised crime. We can state unreservedly, without any doubt - at least on my part - that the approval of this report would represent a European pact against terrorism. Because, for the people of Europe, violence and terror are absolutely incompatible with democracy, dialogue and the rules of the game which the democratic States have set ourselves in order to live together in peace and, in particular, in order to resolve absolutely every - and I stress, absolutely every - one of our problems and differences of whatever nature. Nationalist or independence movements that use terrorist organisations such as ETA in Spain as decoys are only really hiding the reality of their trade whose only objective is to spread terror, destabilise democracy and indiscriminately murder children, young people and adults of any trade or profession. Another argument endorsed by this report is the urgent need to update the legal instruments which a new area without borders, such as the European Union, must have so that it is not easier for the violent people and terrorist groups to carry out their criminal acts than it is for the police and judges to pursue and punish them. Because, Madam President, Commissioner, it is contradictory that there should be barriers and borders for judges and police while, for example, criminal groups organise themselves in one country of the European Union, carry out attacks in another and then return to shelter under legislation that is obsolete and incompatible with a common area of freedom, security and justice. Hence the need for the four recommendations, which are the backbone of the report. It is true that Spain and its government are particularly interested in what we resolve here today, but so should other countries such as France, Belgium, Italy or the United Kingdom or the other countries of the Union, because the roots of terrorism are in violence, its funding, the technological means it employs and the recruitment of young people who are trained, with money and hatred, to kill. And this is a problem, ladies and gentlemen, which transcends the borders of the European Union. Madam President, we are moving in the right direction. I must insist once again on the urgency of the proposals and the urgent need for us to continue truly creating a new area where there is only room and freedom of movement for those of us who want to live in peace and freedom. Commissioner Vitorino has the political support of this House. We genuinely await his proposals with great interest.
costep_2010-12-16_4_17	Mr President, it is quite clear what the resolution under debate is saying - there are to be no exceptions and no derogations. The European Commission is to prepare instruments for enforcement and for penalising production that is not adapted to the requirements. Unfortunately, nothing follows, either, from the statement in the preamble to the resolution that some producers will have had 12 years to adapt, while others will have had eight and yet others only five. I would add that the producers who have been given the shortest length of time to adapt supported the adaptation efforts of their counterparts in the old EU Member States by buying their non-adapted cages, unaware of the problems they were causing for themselves. Experts have found evidence to show that demand for table eggs in the European Union will exceed supply after the Laying Hens Directive has been implemented, which, in practice, will mean imports from third countries of eggs produced in cages which are certainly not adapted. I therefore call on the Commission to assess the feasibility of maintaining the ban on the use of conventional cages from 1 January 2012 while also finding solutions and clearly defined criteria for those producers who will not complete the modernisation process by 1 January 2012, as referred to in two amendments supported by my group. According to its authors, the key argument in favour of adopting this resolution, aside from animal welfare and competitiveness, is the fact that the transitional period for making adaptations was well-known and enshrined in the directive, and that this deadline cannot be changed. I hope that the Members who accept this line of reasoning and vote in favour of the resolution will all be just as determined and unanimous when it comes to voting in favour of there being no further transitional period after 2013 for the differentiation of direct payments in the European Union, since a deadline of 2013 was enshrined in the Treaty for this transitional period. It is enshrined as such, and I do not think we should change it.
costep_2011-06-08_3_24	Mr President, first of all, I would like to pay tribute to Mr Garriga Polledo, including on behalf of the majority of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI), for his excellent work over recent months. The debate on future financial perspectives was very heated and the report put together by Mr Garriga Polledo offers an effective summary that encompasses the positions taken by the different national delegations and the various political groups. In my capacity as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I express my full support for the decision to at least leave the agriculture budget unchanged and I - like many of my colleagues in the AGRI committee - am strongly opposed to the amendment tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) which would accept possible future cuts in agriculture resources in order to fund other activities. I feel compelled to remind my fellow Members that the common agricultural policy is enshrined by the Treaties and is one of the few real European policies; it can play an important role in a strategic sector that provides public goods and generates true European added value.
costep_2009-01-13_9_66	The Lisbon Treaty accords dialogue with citizens the status of an imperative. This is binding on all EU policies and spheres of activity. The success of dialogue depends on representativeness, and therefore on the strong commitment of key entities. National, regional and local authorities should use the method of dialogue, so that citizens can experience participatory democracy working in practice. It should be admitted that the European Union has a lot of ground to make up in the area of communication, and indeed especially in the area of dialogue with citizens. The citizens of the EU must be sure that no decisions at European level will be made without their involvement, and that by voting in elections they will have a real influence on the form of those decisions. I fully support the call by the rapporteur to encourage the promotion of initiatives in the area of dialogue with citizens.
costep_2009-11-25_6_55	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I wish to thank the Swedish Presidency for the great efforts it has made during these months, which have led, amongst other things, to the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon. Finally, after 10 years of institutional impasse, the European Union can resume its trajectory of growth, which was unexpectedly cut short some time ago, by strengthening the codecision procedure. Quite apart from any debate over the qualities of the individuals chosen, the appointments made in recent days have certainly shown that the appointment procedures are far removed from the principles of transparency and responsibility in respect of its citizens that the European Union upholds. This House must undertake to ensure its greater future involvement in negotiations, which cannot and must not be conducted in secret by the States within the Council. Lastly, I hope that we will be able to conclude 2009 by reaching an ambitious agreement at the Copenhagen conference, where the European Union must speak with one voice to express its opinion on climate change.
costep_2001-02-15_8_13	Mr President, one of the greatest humanitarian dramas at present being played out on the world stage is the refugee problem in Guinea. For more than five months hundreds of thousands of refugees from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have been hemmed in between the warring sides. In the border area between these countries, called the 'Parrot’s Beak', they are caught like rats in a trap in fighting between Guinean troops, shadowy rebel movements and the gang of murderers known as the United Revolutionary Front. The personal commitment of the new UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Lubbers, in this crisis area is very gratifying. His proposal for the establishment of a safety corridor, which will enable refugees to return to their home countries quickly, deserves international support. But, all this is not enough. The causes of this humanitarian disaster must be tackled. For example, it would be a good idea to institute an international boycott against the trade in 'blood diamonds', in which this border area is so rich. It is also essential that the international community should present a united front against those principally responsible for the present degrading chaos in West Africa - a task in which the Security Council of the United Nations should take the lead. For this reason we request that the Council and Commission should take action along these lines.
costep_2009-03-09_18_32	Madam President, with regard to this debate we need to be aware, at the end of the day, that this is not a legislative standard - and, therefore, a Community rule applicable to the various Member States - but rather a set of benchmarks which attempts to ensure that, henceforward, all European Union Member States adopt a common approach with respect to small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many aspects to this subject, but I am going to mention three that I certainly believe are important. Firstly, there is a need to remove many of the legal barriers, many of the obstacles and much of the excessive red tape hindering - to an extraordinary extent in certain countries - the creation of small businesses, and also the development of these businesses once they have been created. All this requires financial and human resources to tackle this extraordinary amount of excessive regulation, and these resources can thus not be used for other purposes. Secondly, there are the issues relating to technological innovation and applied research. To this end, we must also redouble our efforts to ensure that SMEs have access to Community programmes, which also, in many cases, suffer from too much red tape. Finally, I believe the relationship between SMEs and the training and educational spheres is vital: if the SMEs, the small businesses, do not become the natural arena for additional skills training at the various training levels, then in fact we, or rather the SMEs, will cease to have certain extraordinary resources, and by that I mean persons being trained.
costep_2010-11-10_18_4	Mr President, what exactly does European innovation policy do? What does European research policy do? If we ask ourselves this question and if we were to ask the citizens on the street, we would just get a blank look. This is because it is not clear what added value European research and European innovation brings. For that reason, we welcome the fact that Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn’s proposal begins by providing a definition of innovation. What is innovation? Innovation involves making money, a product or a licence from knowledge. That is something new. I am pleased that the Commission is going down this path. However, we also now need 'man on the moon' or 'woman on the moon' projects which are understood by the man on the street, so that EU taxpayers understand what we are doing here with their money. In this regard, I see great potential in the issue of increasing the number of healthy life years by two. That would be a project that everyone out there would understand. I am therefore pleased that the first innovation partnership proposed is being devoted precisely to achieving this goal. Two additional healthy years of life - that will be understood by everyone and it is something we should do. In this regard, you have our support. However, I would like to point out, and Mrs Merkies has already mentioned this, too, that if we simply look at the instruments that already exist, there is the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), the Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs), the so-called Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) - these are all programmes that already exist. If we add yet another programme, then we will make the whole area difficult to get to grips with. This is something we must not do. The innovation partnerships are intended to make a real contribution to bringing order to this situation and combining everything in a single system. That is why we will only accept this if it is all made clearer for taxpayers. We must always know the answer to the question: what brings more European added value? If that is the case, we will give it our full support.
costep_2011-06-23_14_144	I am voting in favour of this draft European Parliament legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe. The draft is aimed at consolidating the role of the EU in tuna fisheries in the Atlantic Ocean through legal regulation of the activity of the EU’s fleet. Bearing in mind the relevance of the tuna industry for the EU and for Italy alone, developing the operative framework of the EU’s fleet in the Gulf of Guinea is of primary importance. On the basis of these considerations, I decided to vote in favour of this draft.
costep_2000-05-03_3_5	Madam President, I was extremely interested and curious to hear what Commissioner Schreyer has just said. I must say that we would have preferred to be presented with a written text, but it appears that these ideas have been the subject of internal debates within the Commission and that we will therefore be given a more specific text to study at our leisure. Having said that, I fail to see your grounds for considering that agricultural expenditure is not going to be used in its entirety, as it should, nor how you could release sums, that you describe as minimal, for the heading covering international actions and foreign policy. During the last financial year, we instead felt palpable tension regarding market expenditure and I do not understand what intellectual grounds you have for considering that too much money is being allocated to agriculture, apart from the fact that you need money for the foreign policy heading. Secondly, the same applies to the cuts under heading 4. You tell us that there is such a thing as interregional solidarity. Fine, I can accept that, but what gives you the right - you spoke of very specific criteria, so tell us what they are - what gives you the right to think that too much money has been earmarked for other parts of the world, apart from the fact that you need that money for Kosovo. I think that this is a genuine problem. I will conclude with my third question. I should like to know whether, in the undertakings concerning aid that we gave at the donor conference, we made commitments in US dollars or in euros? Given the state of the euro, I should like to know, if it was in US dollars, how you are dealing with the resulting situation and how you plan to guarantee that there will be strict parallelism between the donations made by the European Union and those made by other donors within the international community?
costep_1997-10-21_8_9	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank Mr Tappin for his excellent report, which raises the problems to do with the Commission’s Green Paper on public procurement. The report is especially important because, as has just been said, public procurement accounts for ECU 720 billion of EU gross domestic product. Public procurement is paid for publicly, that is, the market is responsible to the consumer. That is what Mr Tappin says. Effective public procurement is said to enhance opportunities for industry and business to exploit the common markets and to improve competition for European businesses in world markets. The Commission has, however, had to admit that the Union’s own public procurement has not worked out as effectively as anticipated. The main reason for this situation is the Commission’s lumpy administration together with the fact that the Member States did not adopt directives on public procurement comprehensively enough to implement their contents into the law of the land. Public procurement has proved beyond the reach of small and medium-sized businesses. These, however, must now be on the receiving end, as this sector is seen as one of the most important ways of easing unemployment. I fully agree with Mr Tappin’s proposal appealing for the education and training of staff employed in such companies. Delays in payment to procurement units only help to hinder access to markets on the part of these companies. We here in Parliament must be able to do something about these problems. The main weakness in the operational policy on public procurement by the Commission is that public procurement is seen just as tools for establishing internal markets. These are viewed almost exclusively from the private business angle. The Commission’s document contains no assessment either of how a policy of competitiveness can promote the availability, quality and cost-effectiveness of public services. However, public procurement is actually just part of the administration and service of the public authority. The Commission is also examining the proper procurement process and the problems that go along with it, from the viewpoint of the producer exclusively, and not the private sector. The customers, that is to say the public sector or public authorities, have not had their needs taken into account. Competing for public procurement is also absurd from the point of view of staff. The public procurement process should be improved so that the working conditions and job security of those employed in the procurement service can be taken into account in connection with competitive activity. There should be an increase in public procurement when there is mass unemployment. It is then that market forces and the labour market should be taken into account; and employment, social, and environmental policy must be included in this process.
costep_2003-09-22_1_99	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs voted to reject the Austrian initiative on a regulation establishing criteria for determining the states which qualify as safe third states for the purpose of taking the responsibility for examining an application for asylum lodged by a third-country national. That vote clearly reflects a broad consensus, at least a procedural one, to the effect that this instrument is not a useful one, and that seeing the initiative through to its conclusion would be a wasted effort. This consensus exists in spite of this initiative’s good intentions with regard to the fundamental issue. Mr Schmidt has clearly understood that Parliament does not want to turn its attention away from really important matters, and that it is not prepared to take short-cuts which do not actually lead anywhere. That is why I, and my political group, support the rapporteur’s position. In brief, if I may assess the initiative on its own merits and, to an extent, repeat what has already been said here, its overall scope seems extremely limited, both because 10 of the 15 countries classed as safe third countries on the proposed list have already agreed to implement Dublin II and the whole Schengen acquis, and because, as we all know, it is unclear when Bulgaria and Romania will be in a position to be covered by any Community regulation. That would make the regulation meaningless, since once Norway and Iceland have incorporated the Schengen acquis into their national legislation, only Switzerland would remain on the list presented by Austria. Besides, and here also I am reiterating points which seem uncontroversial, it is hoped that the Directive on minimum standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status will be approved rapidly by the Council, as Parliament demanded in the Watson report and as was promised, furthermore, in Seville. If that happens by the end of the year, as we hope, it would quickly render the Austrian initiative obsolete, since this Directive will resolve the fundamental issue of safe third countries. When all is said and done, then, Mr President, that is why today’s debate took place. The fact is that even after Parliament had made a statement on the matter, we were not subsequently consulted about the revised Commission initiative, amended on 18 June 2002. The message we want to send today, therefore, is that we wish to make our point of view known through this debate on asylum procedures. In the final analysis, that is the crux of the matter, and Parliament cannot accept that a joint solution should be postponed and sacrificed in order to accommodate national prejudices or demands. Rather, we must set aside superfluities and hindrances, devoting ourselves without further ado to the task in hand. Precisely in order to avoid any further ado, therefore, I will thank Commissioner Vitorino, who has today shed some light on the matter and made our short debate entirely worthwhile.
costep_2002-04-09_2_37	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating all the rapporteurs involved for their work on this vast subject. In my opinion, the discharge procedure is a fundamental part of our work and is one of the distinguishing powers of our institution: the power by virtue of which we verify, year after year, that the good intentions and resolves, and also the expectations of the citizens who elected us and for whom we are responsible first and foremost, are fulfilled. This subject is both extremely technical and extremely political, and the consequences for both sectors of decisions taken in haste or under emotional stress can be - and, unfortunately, do often turn out to be - disastrous. That is why I feel that we should ask ourselves before the vote, each year, not so much whether everything has been done perfectly but rather whether we are going in the right direction, whether we are setting ourselves the right priorities, whether, in the executive action of the Commission and - to a much lesser extent - all the other institutions, there is evidence of the intention to implement the will of the two arms of the budgetary authority as well as possible. Concentrating especially on Mr McCartin’s report and, therefore, on the Commission’s budget, I feel that three points warrant particular emphasis; indeed, the rapporteur himself has already stressed them. Firstly, the financial year 2000 has been characterised by an exceptional level of overspending with regard to the budget, which shows that the budgetary forecasts were severely short of the mark. Secondly, although 2000 marked the start of a new programming period for the Structural Funds and preacession aid which stretches until 2006, this cannot have been very successful given that so many difficulties were encountered in implementation. Lastly - and this point may well be more important than the previous two - the rapporteur was right to point out the need to establish, on the one hand, the features of Community management which should be the basis for effectiveness but are deficient, and, on the other, the components within the system which are conducive to fraud and irregularity These are, in my opinion, the areas we must address if we are to achieve proper, sound implementation of the budget in the coming years.
costep_2009-03-11_3_45	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in these times of crisis, our fellow citizens are expecting much of Europe. Europe must not let them down. Of course, if we are being realistic, we have to acknowledge that European financial resources are limited, and we need to look at how they can be improved. However, Europe will come more to the fore and will have more success if it shows greater political will. This involves firstly, of course, acting as a catalyst for the actions and efforts of the Member States, but also taking a coordinated approach at European level. The recovery plan is essentially a toolbox to promote restructuring. The role of the EIB must be strengthened. Europe must act to define a clear, innovative economic strategy. Economic operators need prospects and legal stability. It is important, first, to put financial services in order so that the banking institutions can play their main role, which is to finance economic development. The texts currently being prepared for directives on the capital requirements of banks and insurance companies, and the regulations on rating agencies, must contribute to this task. The text on rating agencies must implement the lessons learned from the proven shortcomings. There is an equally urgent need to provide for European supervision of regulated financial activities. The report by the de Larosière group makes some useful and timely proposals that should be implemented quickly. Europe also needs to be given a proper, effective, modern industrial policy. In this respect, we need to reconcile the needs for sustainable development and the requirement for a high-quality industrial base to produce wealth and create employment. In these times of crisis, it is preferable not to hamper those sectors that are operating normally by producing rules or regulations whose effectiveness has not been properly shown. For example, in the automotive sector, which is today experiencing severe difficulties, it is important to extend the regulation exempting vehicle distribution, which expires in 2010. We must also be vigilant, for example, when negotiating the bilateral agreement with Korea, as it could be very conducive to our industry.
costep_1998-10-06_4_9	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I did not quite understand the reference made by our colleague from the Green Group to Italy and the lack of transparency in the handling of Italian monetary policy; she can explain it to me later. I should now like to turn to the Langen report, naturally to announce that our group will be voting in favour, but also to ask colleagues and the rapporteur to consider the two amendments put forward by Mr Castagnède and myself. It seems to me - and current events and the latest meeting of the ECOFIN Council have made this abundantly clear - that, over and above the many and varied important points made in the report - not only technical ones, but political ones too, of course - one of the key problems in the changeover to the euro is the external representation of the euro. This is missing from the report, despite being at the very heart of the debate over the past few weeks. It is no accident that the ECOFIN Council has still not managed to give a clear indication as to who will represent, in international forums, the monetary and economic policy, the economic and monetary union of the euro zone members. I think that it is important for this issue to be pointed up in the Langen report, so that we can come back to it later and be involved in the overall debate. To my mind, the President of the European Central Bank, and he alone, would be the person to participate in international meetings on behalf of the euro zone members, in the name of EMU. Parliament must, I believe, make it absolutely plain that this issue can no longer be fudged - first all three are to participate, then they are to take turns, then it is to be someone else - because all of this only adds to the confusion, puts us in a poor light and prevents the euro from obtaining the confidence which is crucial to its success. In conclusion, I hope that you will accept these two amendments from the Group of the European Radical Alliance.
costep_2010-04-19_24_4	Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mr Dorfmann for his report. What he has presented clearly shows that there are still a few things that need to be clarified with regard to this matter. Like the speakers before me, I, too, think that the current framework for delimiting these areas is too rough and ready. Many parts of it do not meet the needs of disadvantaged regions. I question whether we will be able to manage with these natural criteria alone. We also need to look closely at the social situation, which plays a major role in disadvantaged regions. As the payments for disadvantaged regions are vital for the survival of many holdings, the Commission needs to think once again about refining the current framework in order to give many regions a chance of survival. I fear that implementation of the current system would lead to very large shifts which are not always comprehensible and will lead to a large amount of disquiet and uncertainty within agriculture. We ought to look at this again.
costep_2002-03-12_2_74	Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the energy sector is not like other sectors, and that is why the discussion cannot be restricted to the question of opening up to competition and the associated timetable. Security of supply, territorial cohesion, network and interconnection development, plant renovation and public service obligations are all essential aspects that involve long-term investment without immediate profitability but which must be guaranteed, if we are to avoid replicating the California crisis. This sector must therefore be closely monitored and a balance maintained between market mechanisms and other imperatives and factors in market organisation. Some Members here advocate opening up to competition. However, when we look at the situation in the various countries, we see that the legislative framework is one thing and the reality of opening is another. Germany, for example, is in theory 100% open, but less than 3% of its electricity is imported. Perhaps it would be better to allow for opening to take place more slowly in order to be able to fulfil our commitments. From this perspective, the date of 1 January 2003 put forward by the Commission for opening with regard to all non-domestic customers is unrealistic and does not even allow time for countries to adopt transposing legislation, where necessary. That is why the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has suggested a period of 24 months after adoption of the directive. In addition to this, along the lines of Amendment No 177 which Mr Herzog has already mentioned, we have asked that the other factors in the organisation of the sector, public service obligation, security of supply, promotion of renewable energy sources, safety of installations and environmental protection be guaranteed operational at the time of opening. Lastly, with regard to domestic customers, households, we must take account of the fact that in some countries, equal tariffs are a key element of public services. Whether the customer lives in the country, in an isolated valley or in a town, they are charged the same price per kW/hour. This is considered part of equal access to public services. That is why we propose that those Member States who so wish be allowed to retain a sector which is not open to competition so that equal tariffs remain possible and equal access to public energy services continues to be a reality in our countries. I hope that the Council will take this into consideration.
costep_2011-01-19_10_16	Mr President, the Confederal Group of the European Unified Left - Nordic Green Left did not participate in the resolution put before us today. We, of course, condemn all acts of terrorism, irrespective of who the perpetrators or victims are and of where they are carried out. However, our group’s members firmly believe in secular principles and a secular society. We therefore naturally condemn blasphemy. This means that we believe strongly in freedom of thought, freedom of conscience and freedom of religion, which includes the freedom to believe or not to believe, to choose one’s religion, change religion and to freely practise the religion of one’s choosing regardless of which religion that is. It also means that we are firmly committed to the separation between religion and politics and we condemn the rise of fundamentalism in Europe and elsewhere, which is often a response to social unrest and the inability of public policy to address it. We believe that this resolution is a step in the wrong direction. To put it briefly, I would say that it lacks balance, especially in comparison with the motion tabled by my group. We feel this resolution gives the impression that Christian Europe, or the Christian community in Europe, is running to the aid of Christians throughout the world. We do not think this is the best way to combat the rise of these sectarian attitudes.
costep_2008-01-17_4_4	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Second Internet Governance Forum was held in Rio from 12 to 15 November last year, and was attended by 2 100 people from all five continents representing interested Internet parties from all public and private sectors. The forum provides a favourable context in which to seek solutions to future ICT problems. Through a common culture and a partnership format, it provides the decisions to be taken at future world summits on the information society, in addition to those to be taken by our own states. It also provides the opportunity to hold an open reflection on the complex nature of the Internet and make timely provision for its technical, ethical and legal limitations, since there are major concerns in addition to the issues close to EU hearts: reducing the digital divide, freedom of expression on the web, cultural diversity and child protection. I could also RFID, radio frequency identification, in short, the formation of an Internet of things, the risks of network overload by 2010-2012, digitalisation, particularly of cultural goods, the consequences arising in terms of the protection of intellectual property and, above all, improvement of access to ICT for less developed countries. Europe is certainly up to speed in terms of the legislative process. This is encouraging for us as Europeans, but we must not slacken off. Many of these legal or regulatory issues are likewise improved with the review of the Telecom Package. In this respect, I would call for a new phase of targeted political and future-oriented work, notably through the creation of a European IGF involving the national parliaments and local authorities: a European forum implemented by 2009 and perhaps a world forum in Europe thanks to Lithuania’s application for 2010. As delegation head, I wish to thank all Members, colleagues and officials for their work and their availability. The resolution we will be voting on constitutes a roadmap. I am pleased it enjoys the support of all of the groups in Parliament. More parliamentary committees are welcome to lend their weight to this course of action, and I would like to thank the Commission and ask its Members to lend their support to Mrs Reding. Finally, I would like to ask the Council to include in its agenda relations with India and preparations for the New Delhi forum, and I would urge all Member States to participate in enhanced cooperation.
costep_2010-11-10_18_13	We welcome the Commission’s efforts to put research and innovation at the top of the political agenda. We are looking at an integrated strategy to make the European innovation ecosystem more effective and productive in the service of a sustainable economy. European innovation partnerships have emerged as an instrument and the major challenges around which they are organised are sufficiently broad not to be controversial. However, it remains unclear how the subsidiary priorities will be defined, and also how the preponderance of each discipline within them will be determined. How much transparency can be expected in order for stakeholders to participate? How will conflicting interests be arbitrated? What role will the Commission, the Member States and the regions play? How can accountability be ensured within a complex structure? What financial dimension will these partnerships have? Mr President, the Commission and the Council have to ensure excellence in implementation, which is not guaranteed given the mere months of pilot testing scheduled for the first partnership.
costep_2010-03-10_8_90	I voted for this resolution as I believe that the EU 2020 strategy must provide an effective response to the economic and financial crisis and give new impetus and European coherence to the recovery process in the EU by mobilising and coordinating national and European instruments. I support the need for better cooperation with national parliaments and civil society as the involvement of more players will increase the pressure on national administrations to deliver results. At the same time, I believe that European industry should use its pioneering role in the sustainable economy and green mobility technologies by exploiting its export potential. This will reduce resource dependency and facilitate compliance with the necessary 20-20-20 climate change targets.
costep_2010-06-15_18_10	I would like to express my very warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for the way in which he has handled this dossier and congratulate him on all the work he has done. I strongly support what he said earlier, not only for the current evaluation based on data protection, but also for the other reports due to be drafted in the areas which remain to be evaluated. The Council must be able to guarantee that it can provide MEPs with all the information required to enable Parliament to adopt a suitable, fair decision. I sincerely hope that we will reach a solution so that we can carry out our work in normal conditions and make enlightened decisions.
costep_2000-03-15_3_45	This debate on air quality concerns the particular problem of ozone in ambient air, as set out in the Davies report. All the experts agree that it is essential to raise standards of air quality so that people throughout the European Union are protected effectively against health risks posed by ozone in ambient air. The various health effects of ozone include irritation to eyes, nose and throat, difficulty in breathing, coughs and headaches. Ozone also contributes to asthmatic attacks, impaired lung function and increased bronchial reactivity. In the long term, this can even cause premature ageing of lungs. These facts are frightening to say the least, which is why I warmly welcome this proposed directive. It aims to amend the existing Community legislation on ozone in accordance with the requirements of Council Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and management. It sets long-term objectives and interim target values for ozone in ambient air. It also introduces a framework of standards to protect human health and the environment. Finally, it requires Member States to monitor ozone concentrations and to report the results to the public. The directive will therefore provide a benchmark for the levels of ozone in ambient air. In setting long-term objectives, the Commission proposes to use the 1997 World Health Organisation air quality guidelines. The ultimate aim is to prevent these long-term objectives being exceeded and thereby avoid harmful effects on human health and the environment. However, the Commission’s proposals do not set a deadline for this to be achieved. This is to be regretted. As a first interim step, target values are set. The aim is to achieve these, as far as possible, by 2010. These are also based on the WHO guidelines, but it is accepted that these will be exceeded on a number of days each year. It must be pointed out that the Commission proposal does not take account of any changes which may result from the Community’s climate change commitments. These currently call for an 8% reduction in a range of greenhouse gases. Success in meeting these commitments should enable Member States to be more ambitious regarding target values for the reduction of ozone levels. To conclude, I am fairly satisfied with the text of this proposed directive as it takes an important step towards attaining the ultimate goal set out in the fifth Environmental Action Programme of never exceeding critical levels of ozone in ambient air. Myller report A5-0063/2000
costep_2008-01-30_17_21	Thank you, Mr President. This House has, in long debates, discussed the Israeli-Palestinian issue too many times. We should, however, recognise that, objectively speaking, the role that the European Union has managed to play to date as regards this situation has been altogether marginal: so many proclamations, declarations of intent, motions and documents but, in truth, very little consistency as far as actions are concerned. I recently visited Palestine and I found an atmosphere of distress, disillusionment and resignation among the people, who are tired of years of broken promises: the situation is becoming worse and there is a serious risk of driving the Palestinian territories into the arms of Hamas extremists. The air that you breathe there is heavy, and recourse to violence seems almost unavoidable. Just now, time is really running out: either Europe will have the strength and the capability to turn this situation around or we shall, all of us, bear the responsibility of not having done enough to avert the worst.
costep_2009-02-18_27_5	Non-lucrative activities and not-for-profit organisations are experiencing continual growth in Europe. At this time of economic and financial crisis, which has serious repercussions at social level, strengthening an economy founded on social benefits rather than profit is a strategic choice that allows us to alleviate the impact of the crisis and to pursue the development of the Lisbon strategy by realising one of its primary objectives, namely the call to social responsibility. Secondly, the social economy is able to initiate action at local level, becoming a reliable partner for public administrations which need to plan measures to support the vulnerable in society. We should therefore welcome the move by the European Parliament to recognise, in legislation and statistics, those organisations that operate and are deeply rooted in the European fabric due to their ability to achieve social objectives. This is a grass-roots vision that represents a fundamental contribution to the European social model.
costep_2011-06-23_14_517	As the last year has shown, the Stability and Growth Pact, which was supposed to be an effective means of preventing Member States from breaching the macroeconomic policies of the euro area, has - to put it mildly - not been very successful. This was to a large extent due to the fact that Member States felt they would not be punished, because the sanctions provided for in the system were not applied automatically. The measures which have been proposed centre mainly around stronger coordination of the fiscal policy of individual Member States and tougher and automatic sanctions intended to force Member States to maintain greater macroeconomic discipline.
costep_2011-04-06_17_5	Mr President, as we speak, hopefully the end of the Côte d'Ivoire crisis is imminent. We would all like to hear that Mr Gbagbo has surrendered in the next few hours. The international community has been very patient, the African Union has undertaken several rounds of mediation, and the United Nations chose not to intervene between the two sides for several months. The United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) has now taken action, with support from the French Licorne troops and in accordance with the Security Council resolution, but it has done so in order to protect civilians from the heavy weaponry used by the incumbent regime. The crisis in Côte d'Ivoire should now serve as an example to all those who refuse to give up power despite electoral defeat. These individuals need to understand that, from now on, the international community is determined to enforce the law. Yet in strife-torn countries, where the concept of nationhood is still evolving, we cannot be satisfied with declaring a victor. We must strive for national reconciliation. This is the message that we now need to send to Mr Ouattara, who will be responsible for establishing a national unity government. As each camp has accused the other of massacres and crimes against humanity, investigations need to be initiated with a view to apportioning blame and dispensing justice. Justice can involve vengeance, but it can also bring peace. I would like to plead in favour of the latter option, if that will allow Côte d'Ivoire to rediscover peace and stability and to see growth and development resume.
costep_2011-04-06_20_48	When we review the European Neighbourhood Policy, it is important to assess the impact of this policy on migration. No Neighbourhood Policy can be fully effective in this area without tackling the causes of instability that trigger migration. This entails regional cooperation, potentially via bilateral agreements, with both the countries of origin and with transit countries. We must cooperate with transit countries and with countries of origin for migration so as to prevent surges. We must help the migrants' countries of origin to democratise and attain good governance by giving them access to our values and our experience. With regard to the European Neighbourhood Policy, we need an economic agenda which can increase levels of employment and trade agreements that can generate real, market-driven, economic development. Commissioner Füle and High Representative Ashton support, with the 'more for more' formula, the concept of conditions for aid which aim to reward the countries most active in terms of democratic reforms and respect for human rights. This approach should be encouraged, as it is consistent with our values, effective for development, and does right by European taxpayers.
costep_2010-05-18_5_7	Madam President, I would like to start with the magic word 'balance' once again, which Mr Haglund has just mentioned. I actually believe that, as we now discuss the 2011 budget, we must take as our starting point the question 'How can we find a proper and responsible balance?' Mr Fernandes spoke of popularism in relation to Parliament’s considered idea of being very responsible and self-disciplined in the 2011 budget. I completely disagree with him in this regard. I do not believe that it is popularism for us to together come to the considered conclusion that, in the light of the many cutbacks that we are demanding of other countries, we too need to examine very closely how we in Parliament must act with self-discipline. On the contrary, I believe that to be precisely the political responsibility of the European Parliament in the current circumstances. In the cutbacks that are being demanded of Greece and public budgets in general, we must have the courage, on the one hand, to legitimise the increases that we do need in order to do our work responsibly and yet, at the same time, to find a limit where we say: under present conditions, we also require a certain delimitation, as that is simply a part of the political landscape. This must be signalled according to the maxim 'We have understood!' That is important from a political point of view, and I therefore once again call on all the groups to consider what signal we will be giving the public with the 2011 budget.
costep_2007-11-14_9_24	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a serious climate problem. No one is denying that. The political issue, however, is how we approach the effort to solve the problem. I must say that we have had great difficulties with the present report as regards the manner in which the problem is being addressed. Problems are not solved by describing doomsday scenarios and speaking of human-rights violations or by adopting a disheartening tone instead of proposing solutions. The aim must be to search realistically and objectively for solutions, weighing up diverse arguments. In this respect I find it regrettable that we have not been prepared to countenance divergent assessments regarding the causes of climate trends and changes. I am all for the inclusion of ambitious goals, but it is also essential to ensure that they are achievable, otherwise our climate policy will be ineffectual. It is also wrong to establish taboos and say that the subject of coal and the development of clean-coal technology or the subject of nuclear power are off limits and that the only answer is renewable energy. Such an approach completely fails to address the problem. What is needed is a comprehensive debate in which all aspects are examined in detail and in which we are all open to a variety of instruments and to information from a wide range of sources. I believe we should also consider, as part of that debate, what impact we can achieve with what resources. How do we maximise the impact? We should also reflect on costs. I believe we should not only focus on the way in which national political decisions are taken but also consider, as one or two colleagues have said to me, how the development of technology can be spurred on and supported. I do not see any sense in holding today’s debate and then, two or three hours or two or three days later, discussing Lisbon strategies and the like in the same chamber. These two debates must be rolled into one if we want to fight climate change and mitigate its effects. In my view there has been only a limited opportunity here to voice the critical comments that we aired in our deliberations in committee. I hope that the next time, when we deal with the full report from the Committee on Climate Change, we shall have a chance to put forward a rather wider spectrum of arguments.
costep_2010-11-24_16_12	Madam President, the violence that has shaken the Western Sahara, which we strongly condemn, just as we regret the loss of human life and demand respect for human rights, must not break out again. There needs to be a permanent, fair and mutually acceptable solution, within the framework of the United Nations, to a conflict that has now gone on for more than 30 years and is condemning thousands of Saharan refugees to despair and condemning a neighbouring area that is of fundamental importance to the European Union to instability. We therefore call on Morocco, which is a prominent and reliable partner of the European Union, with which we share major interests and plans, to redouble its efforts at dialogue in order to bring a negotiated end to the conflict. We also call for calm among the Saharan people and their representatives, to whom we offer a message of solidarity in their circumstances. We also call on them to maintain dialogue with an open and constructive attitude. We ask the European Union to join in the efforts of the group of countries that are friends of the Sahara, which includes my own country, Spain, in facilitating that dialogue as a credible negotiator in the region. The opening of a Moroccan parliamentary investigation into the events in the Sahara and the fact that the Moroccan authorities are prepared to inform Parliament about what has happened are significant signs that we do value. They are not, however, a substitute for a policy of information transparency ensuring the presence of all media in the area. The resolution that we will adopt tomorrow is the result of a complex agreement which reflects Parliament’s concern regarding stability in the Maghreb and for human rights. It is also a demonstration of Parliament’s backing for a negotiated end to the conflict, with no prior conditions, but on the basis of the United Nations Security Council resolutions establishing the Saharan people’s right to self-determination.
costep_1999-04-16_5_7	Mr President, I should like to begin where Mr Sonneveld left off. My group too feels that is it particularly important for the balancing premium between potato starch and cereal starch to be maintained. It is vital that potato production should be maintained in various parts of Europe, and particularly in the north of the Netherlands, otherwise there would be a huge economic slump which would cost us even more money to resolve. So it certainly needs to be maintained. I would also like to express my support for the industrial use of agricultural products for non-food purposes. I am pleased that Commissioner Liikanen is here at the moment, because I would like to make a suggestion that will cost nothing at all, which I am sure he will be delighted to hear. What if we made it compulsory in certain ecologically sensitive areas, for example in Finnish waters, to use products that can be made from agricultural products, such as plastics that can be made from starch and biolubricants that can be made from protein-rich products in the south of Europe? This would create an enormous new market for these products and we would probably need to spend less on subsidies. I admit that these products might be a little dearer than the conventional ones, but the environmental benefits are so great that I think the Commission should come up with some definite proposals to give these products greater access to the European market. I also wanted to ask something about the situation after Berlin. We all know that the Blair House agreement was not very advantageous for us. How confident is the Commission that the current proposals are compatible, in other words that we can grow as much as we want and the Blair House restriction no longer applies? Or are we going to have another trade dispute with the US in the WTO? I hope not, and I would like to hear what the Commission has to say on this point.
costep_2001-10-23_12_4	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Rühle’s report on the discharge for the European Development Funds presents an honest picture of the contradictions in our development policy. On the one hand, there are complaints that we are not willing enough to make generous development aid available, and, on the other hand, it is undeniable that the money actually made available is often only disbursed very slowly. There must be something wrong with a system under which at the end of 1999 resources of almost EUR 10 billion had been promised and made available without any specific deadlines, but had not been taken up. The Commission will, of course, say that since then there have been signs of improvement here and there. Nevertheless, it is a fact that we need to fundamentally review our approach. The aid we offer through the Development Funds is reaching its limits, because it is geared towards supporting states that in some cases only exist on paper. There is often a lack of an even semi-functioning public administration, there is a lack of democratic control of those in power, and many countries are in a state of open civil war or on the verge of it. In a civil war situation, we first need to concentrate aid on conflict resolution and on humanitarian aid. In other cases, we should concentrate our efforts to a greater extent than before on establishing properly functioning public administrations, which are a prerequisite for meaningfully applying aid from the EU or other donors in the international community. Such administrations are also a prerequisite for ensuring that countries use their own tax revenue responsibly and in the interests of their citizens. Our aid must therefore always be linked to reform programmes for public administration. If these reforms make progress, aid is given, but if they do not progress or if there are setbacks we should not be afraid to turn off the tap. I know that is a difficult thing to do, but it is precisely in such circumstances that the Commission needs to stand firm and adhere to its principles. Finally, I would like to say one more thing about this discharge procedure. The discharge had to be postponed because the Commission did not initially provide the necessary information. Furthermore, there was again the problem that certain confidential information was only forwarded to the committee chair and to the rapporteur. As I have often said before, and I shall say it again now, this leads to two classes of Member of the European Parliament - those with and those without access to information. The committee made it patently clear in its report that this situation should not be allowed to recur, and that the provisions of our Rules of Procedure in respect of the discharge procedure should be fully implemented in future. In other words, all Members of this House should have access to all confidential information.
costep_2007-10-25_8_36	The recent rise in food prices is due largely to successive reforms in the CAP, the abandonment of production thereby promoted, and the resulting disappearance of many small and medium-sized farms. Ignoring the specific reality of Member States to take greater account of the interests of the large agri-industrial enterprises, multinational food distributors and negotiations to liberalise trade within the WTO has helped to change the basis of agricultural activity, leading to a fall in output. Meanwhile, the use of agricultural products for non-food purposes, particularly for producing biofuels, which they seek to prioritise, will not help to develop agricultural activity and may, on the contrary, replace the production of food products, thereby having a negative impact on the protection of food sovereignty. We therefore believe it is essential to reappraise the objectives of the common agricultural policy in order to increase food product output, support small and medium-sized agricultural and livestock holdings and moderate consumer prices, reinforcing intervention mechanisms and ensuring appropriate intervention prices.
costep_1997-03-13_2_28	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now that the leaden casing of the USSR has melted away, we can make one observation and one request. The observation is that in Transcaucasia, as in many other places, the problems with nationalities, borders, minorities and ethnic and religious differences that existed in the past have survived almost intact. Sometimes their effect is supplemented by the legacy of fragmentation practised by the USSR, as in Nagorny Karabakh, for example. The request is that we should approach this situation in a totally new spirit, aimed at finding lasting solutions. That is the context of the joint agreement on Armenia which we are being asked to approve today. To give that country the opportunity to strengthen its independence, to deepen its democracy, to open up more to international relations, to orient itself towards a market economy, to diversify its trade flows which are too exclusively geared to the former USSR, to achieve the lifting of the blockade and then develop a sound, trusting policy of regional cooperation with its neighbours - those are the objectives of this agreement, and I approve of them. I hope that Europe will use its influence to ensure that these things do happen, and to ensure in particular that Armenia has the right of freedom of trade, one of the foundations of the rights of nations, which will enable it in particular to close down a dangerous nuclear power station and will also be an essential condition for lasting peace in that region.
costep_2010-11-11_9_58	This is the first European directive that will regulate high-risk investment funds - hedge funds - and is the culmination of a negotiation process that has lasted more than a year. As the document says, the new rules aim to control the activities of managers and ensure greater transparency in the management of these funds, to protect investors and promote the stability of the financial markets. However, in truth, we have not got to the bottom of this issue: these speculative funds have not been abolished and there is still a derivatives market, meaning that the mechanisms allowing speculation still exist. An excellent opportunity to properly regulate the financial markets has been wasted. The Council and the majority of the European Parliament yielded in the face of enormous pressure from the financial lobby. The financial crisis has shown that the origins of the global financial system’s dysfunctions are, firstly, excessive exposure to risk - these funds are an example of this - and, secondly, the weakness of the systems for managing this risk. The new European regulations establish common requirements for the authorisation and supervision of hedge funds, but they are far from preventing the continuation of serious systemic risk. We cannot, therefore, vote for this proposal. However, new directives are being debated and negotiated, so it is still possible to get to the bottom of the issue, specifically to put an end to these speculative funds. We will see.
costep_2003-02-13_4_130	Mr President, I might inform you that purely coincidentally the German Parliament is also debating Zimbabwe at this very hour today and I believe that, from a political point of view, it is important for us not only to discuss this issue here in the European Parliament - or perhaps also, for historical reasons, in London - but also in other parliaments in Europe, so as to raise public awareness of the situation. Regrettably, it is necessary to extend the sanctions imposed on the Mugabe regime. The use of democratic means has, unfortunately, not enabled the people there to rid themselves of a potentate who bears more responsibility than anyone else for the decline of the country in economic, social and political terms and also in respect of human rights. I have to take issue with what Mr Sylla said. The sanctions that we introduced do not actually affect the general public. The only people that are hit by them are those who in any case have the money to travel. But when, for example, the 'propaganda minister', Mr Moyo, went to South Africa on a shopping spree over Christmas, it caused a public outcry in that democratic society too that someone so close to the regime should be behaving in this way. I very much regret the fact that the discussions about extending the sanctions degenerated into political horse-trading, because France would only agree to the extension if Mr Mugabe was allowed to come to Paris for the Franco-African summit. I do not like to criticise a government whose political views are so close to my own, but in this case I would urge the French Government to consider whether it is in the interests of Africans to engage in African politics in this way. Unfortunately, in previous decades for many European countries one single criterion has been decisive in determining whether they have got involved in African politics: whether it served their own economic interests. The result is clear to see in countries such as Côte d'Ivoire and Congo. On the contrary, it is important for Europe to present a united front. I therefore welcome the fact that Portugal would rather postpone the EU-Africa summit than allow President Mugabe to travel here. Moreover, at the 59th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Europeans must carry out early consultations so as to ensure that any draft resolution on Zimbabwe does not fail to go through, as happened last year, but that it is removed from the agenda beforehand.
costep_1997-11-05_5_17	Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I believe that, despite everything, international relations are not always a jungle. I recognize that this report is still an initial report, but I wish to express my overall satisfaction with Mrs Fraga Estévez’s text, even if I do not agree with some of the views that she puts forward. It represents an initial contribution, and the European Parliament has done well to get down to work, to take a lead in this debate, and to endeavour to set out a position in the future discussion of the common fisheries policy after 2002. I should like to address three specific points. First, the question of international fisheries agreements. I wish to express my reservations in principle concerning the renationalization of the common fisheries policy. Indeed, returning responsibility for the funding of international fisheries agreements to the various Member States, making them dependent on national budgets - although, in the short term, it would provide a solution to the restrictions, problems and concerns raised by those who question these agreements - would, in my view, undermine the Commission’s authority in a key area of the common fisheries policy. Consequently, application of the subsidiarity principle must be restricted to the private domain, to dealings with producers' organizations, to the dialogue with vessel owners - possibly with the support of the regions, but without renationalizing the overall negotiation of international fisheries agreements. My second point concerns structural policy - and it is not possible to disconnect this issue from the question of Agenda 2000. I wish to condemn the fact that fisheries are inadequately taken into account in Agenda 2000, and that the separation of objectives 1 and 2, in the present framework, is excessively rigid, with greater importance being attached to strictly development objectives. This will place fisheries in a secondary and subordinate position in future Community support frameworks. Thirdly, the question of rebalancing fleet capacity and resources. I do not believe that rebalancing fleet capacity and resources is the only way to reduce catches, although I am in favour of the establishment of, and compliance with - and, I stress, compliance with - the multiannual guidance programmes. It is important to stress that the reduction of the fishing effort can also be achieved by reducing the number of fishing days, controlling landings and implementing technical measures for the conservation and protection of fisheries resources. Finally, our group supports the attachment of increased importance to environmental aspects, notably as regards the adoption of a precautionary approach, referred to in the draft report, and the upholding of the principle of relative stability. Indeed, if we fail to preserve the fisheries sector, there will be no fishermen to discuss the common fisheries policy after 2002.
costep_2007-03-15_3_21	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take just one important area from my colleague Francesco Musotto’s very good report, an area whose importance not only for the islands concerned but for the EU as a whole should not be underestimated, namely the problem of illegal immigration. This problem of illegal immigration must in my opinion be tackled more effectively, having as it does a highly disproportionate effect on the EU’s islands in the Mediterranean. Even though progress has already been made with the measures the EU has taken - with the development of an integrated border management system and the establishment of a community code on the rules governing the movement of persons across any kind of borders, for example - the immigration figures nevertheless show that those measures are still not enough. Even though the competence for measures clearly lies with the Member States and will have to remain with them in future, the islands cannot be made to carry the excessive burden alone simply because of their geographical position, because what is at first sight a Spanish, Italian or Greek problem subsequently becomes a problem for the whole of Europe and therefore also calls for a response at Community level. Solidarity in action is what is required here and must be made reality. In this connection, the creation of a European coastguard to monitor the EU’s external borders would certainly be no panacea for this island problem, but this proposal of Mr Musotto’s does deserve to be examined to see whether it could be one of many measures to combat illegal immigration and protect the islands and the EU as a whole.
costep_2010-05-20_6_2	Mr President, thank you for your statement. I should like to add that our Hungarian friends are in the same situation as our Polish friends in terms of floods. We therefore have the same thoughts for our Hungarian fellow citizens as for our Polish fellow citizens. Applause I endorse your presentation. In a crisis situation, democratic forces must join together. It is with this in mind that I had proposed to the Conference of Presidents, before this Strasbourg session, that this decision be postponed to June, because I had noticed certain discrepancies and ambiguities. I did not obtain a majority at the Conference of Presidents - we are a democratic Parliament here - and we have therefore tried to prepare this resolution. At lunchtime yesterday, during discussions in our respective groups, we realised that time was short. I do not want to say that the work was botched, as that would be to refuse to recognise the work done by our services, our Vice-Presidents and the people responsible for preparing this work. We thought, before all or some of the heads of delegation, that it would probably be best, for Parliament’s image, to get the text withdrawn and to vote next time; the crisis, may I point out, will not be over by the month of June. We discussed the matter and we agreed to decide that the heads of the large groups would ask for the vote to be postponed until June. Martin Schulz told me - and was the only one to do so - that first of all, I needed the majority of the group, but everyone needs the majority of the group. We did not therefore discuss amendments in our group yesterday evening, nor did we discuss the resolution today, as the group was in favour of postponement, in order to find a solution, which Parliament considers indispensable towards our fellow citizens. In the meantime, we have received a letter from Guy Verhofstadt; that is what made us decide to request a simple three-week postponement. In this crisis situation, I am asking you to grant it so that we, Parliament, can show our fellow citizens that we are a strong body and responsible men and women.
costep_2002-09-03_2_33	Mr President, Commissioner, I, on the other hand, welcome the adoption of this raft of measures today with satisfaction, and if we have any cause for regret at all, it is that it has taken so long to achieve: we have wasted 10 years over this dispute between Spain and the United Kingdom - which was not even based on historical fact - but it cannot be helped. Today, at last, a new horizon has opened up before us. I have to say that, in any case, a great many difficulties arose because the dossier was and still is genuinely complex, and its passage has certainly not been smooth. The effects of this complexity have been felt even today in this House, although it is clear to everybody that there are many economic, safety, environmental and consumer protection justifications for producing this package: we have seen the amount of delays, the level of air traffic congestion, the costs of this congestion and the difficulties of creating new airspaces in terms of safety. Despite the fact that we can all see that there are more than excellent reasons why we need this raft of measures, objections have been raised even today and have taken a number of different forms: the rather unusual reference to the States' sovereignty, cooperation with the military authorities, which has suddenly become so vital - I am particularly surprised to see the far left showing such deference towards the military authorities - and the confusion between liberalisation and privatisation. These are all objections which, in my view, in actual fact conceal a certain resistance and the desire to maintain the status quo, the desire not to change, which is the exact opposite of what our citizens are demanding from us. Commissioner, there are many areas in which Europe needs to take a step backwards rather than forwards, where it must not take over the functioning and competences of the individual States, but this is not one of them. Our citizens are demanding this initiative, and so you must press ahead resolutely and give us a Single Sky through which everyone can travel safely and without concern.
costep_1999-12-15_10_78	Mr President, last Monday the Socialist Group tried to include a motion for a resolution in the agenda of this plenary sitting which would have highlighted the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, demonstrated the commitment of the European Parliament to the principles of international humanitarian law and expressed our support for the International Committee of the Red Cross. As a result of a mix-up amongst the Groups in this Parliament, and we think that this was more a matter of procedure than a disagreement over the content of the motion, it was not included in this debate. In later sittings, however, we will insist on attention being given to the importance of this issue, which has been well highlighted in the reply of the representative of the Council. In fact, the basic principles of international humanitarian law, which are contained in the Geneva Conventions, are values which must be maintained as a basis for European construction and promoted through institutional activities. In any event, the European Union must be an agent for peace and international humanitarian law and it must assist the ICRC in its task of guaranteeing that this law is upheld. Furthermore, the European Union must provide as much aid as possible to relieve the suffering of victims and we must, at last, contribute to the education of our citizens in terms of respect for peace. For all these reasons, on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, at a time when we must all commit ourselves - Parliament, Commission and Council - to promoting awareness of international humanitarian law and supporting the organisations responsible for its protection, does the Council propose any specific initiative to promote the knowledge of international humanitarian law amongst the citizens of the Union?
costep_2002-10-09_3_110	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks and, on behalf of my group, I would like to thank Mr Berend, who has speedily drawn up this excellent report in exceptional circumstances. We must certainly all agree that we need a flexible tool that allows for quick action to repair damage caused by major disasters. Establishing the Solidarity Fund is such an important issue, however, that more time should have been set aside to discuss it. During the Committee debate and afterwards many factors came up which we have had insufficient time to consider properly. Our group is in favour of establishing the fund. The threshold for the use of the aid must be kept high. The fund must concentrate on immediate costs during the initial stage of major natural disasters. Actual reconstruction does not form part of the fund’s remit. Risk factors must be addressed through insurance and preventive measures whenever possible. It is also important that the fund should not become a new variation on the Structural Funds, to be used up on a yearly basis. It must only be used when there has been an exceptional, major disaster, when help is really needed. One or two questions came up after the committee debate. I would like to ask the Commissioner what the position will be on major disasters taking place in third countries and resulting in suffering for people in the Member States and the applicant countries. Secondly, what will the maximum amount of aid be as a percentage of the costs of damage?
costep_2011-06-22_18_46	Adoption of the economic governance package proves yet again that the European project is still alive and that it is on the basis of conciliation among the 27 that the Member States will overcome their difficulties and, at the same time, confront the challenges of the future. The sovereign public debt crisis shows that the current supervisory and remedial mechanisms are inadequate. The measures put to the vote today seek to strengthen the instruments that are not working, and therefore it is essential that they are put into practice. The debt criterion, as approved in the Treaty of Maastricht, is at last made operational in this new package and will now actually be applied. The institutionalisation of the European semester, the enhancement of the dialogue between the European institutions and national bodies, the role of Parliament and the Commission throughout the monitoring process, as well as greater and more effective supervision are all ways of achieving intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth in Europe. However, I must stress that the success of Europe’s economic policy must also depend on other, complementary measures to support investment and growth in the Member States. Europe must focus on a common strategy, but it must not forget the specific features of each country.
costep_2011-04-06_9_497	Following the Monti report on relaunching the Single Market, the Commission has submitted the paper 'Towards a Single Market Act', drawn up under the leadership of Commissioner Barnier, for public consultation. On the basis of the contributions received and the priorities set, the Commission will propose a definitive version of this Act, which will contain a dozen priority measures for completing the Single Market. That is why it is important for Parliament to look at its priorities and to send a clear message to the Commission beforehand. This 'governance and partnership' resolution, which I supported, calls for stronger political leadership, an improvement in the implementation of legislation relating to the Single Market, and the introduction of tools for good governance (reducing the transposition deficit, alleviating administrative burdens, partnership with local authorities, stronger involvement of national Parliaments, dialogue with civil society, and so on). One priority that has been identified is an alternative method of conflict resolution. On this point, I am disappointed that we neglected collective redress. This omission is a missed opportunity for the European Parliament to affirm its commitment to introduce such an instrument quickly.
costep_1997-05-28_8_6	Mr President, everyone knows that social employment and budgetary policies are inextricably linked to taxation. Tax fraud and evasion, complex systems, no machinery for exchanging information, the increased tax burden on the labour market, the proliferation of 'offshore' areas and more favourable tax regimes and impediments to the circulation of capital as a consequence of different rules for determining taxable objects and tax rates, inter alia, royalties and savings, are all obviously factors which explain the phenomenon of taxation competition. Effectively solving all of these problems is something demanded by all those, including myself, who think that the single market, which is both free and fair, also requires fiscal systems that are fair, balanced and neutral. How it might be possible to overcome these difficulties was the response which we thought we would be able to find in this report. However, we think that this is not quite the case. Indeed, we note that, in this context, the Treaty on European Union has gone no further but it already contains solutions which, if put into practice, could solve some of the problems arising from tax erosion, which Community institutions so far seem not to have succeeded in overcoming. We are referring to the Directive in Article 220 on the rule for reaching a bilateral agreement on taxation matters. As you know, these treaties deal with all categories of income, aimed to eliminate dual taxation, bilaterally harmonizing effective taxation rates at source and in the place of residence and avoiding tax invasion. It seems that this analysis has not been carried out and, in particular, assessment of the adoption and application of these treaties in the Community area. I am surprised at this, and I am also surprised at the approach to mechanisms, such as those for changing the rule on unanimity over taxation matters, virtually without testing the political and practical consequences of the agreements referred to. The Community has gone no further at this moment than a Directive on dividends, on acts of concentrating businesses and on the prices of transfers between associated undertakings. Harmonization of taxation on interest has been held up for a long time now in the corridors of politics. Therefore, I think that the proposals already tested, but without proven success, should now be renewed. This is not, from my point of view, an appropriate response. In these circumstances, the effective creation of a single market, the fight against unemployment, the improvement in social conditions and the elimination of impediments to free circulation will be achieved through a concerted policy and incentives to reaching bilateral agreements on taxation matters. When, as in this case, fiscal sovereignty is at stake, consultation and consensus - from my point of view - should prevail.
costep_2000-10-04_4_3	Mr President, what I enjoy most about this House is that I am always learning new things. Today, for instance, I learned that, at the time when my esteemed colleagues Graefe zu Baringdorf and Böge were in the Landjugend - in other words until very recently, in a manner of speaking - there were open declarations. So that in itself has already made my morning. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, the rapporteur from the committee which was ultimately entrusted with responsibility for this report, said that we have long been pressing for this open declaration and that we have redoubled our exhortations to the Commission on the marketing of compound feed since the BSE episode. He rightly praised the Commission for its more or less prompt fulfilment of its mandates. The Commission’s proposal is sound, and I am convinced that we shall muster enough agreement within the House on the few amendments to be able to stand up to the Council on this issue. I entirely fail to comprehend why the manufacturers of compound feed - who have spoken to many of us, as you know - believe that resistance against open declarations will achieve anything. It will get them nowhere. As we have all been saying in our speeches, whether here in the House or in our home constituencies, we must begin to win back the public trust that we have lost, and we must be unstinting in our efforts to do so. That entails a host of measures. One such measure is the introduction of open declarations, and an open declaration is not merely an indication of the percentage of various content categories or generic classifications but clear and precise details of the ingredients contained in the feed mix. It is unacceptable to have 'starch', 'fats' or 'protein' on the packaging; the manufacturer must state which protein and which fats are in the mix. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf made that quite clear. But we need more than that, which is why both the Agriculture Committee and the Environment Committee have stated once again, rather in the fashion of a Tibetan prayer wheel, that we need a white list. We need a white list of the additives and ingredients that are authorised for use in feed mixes. The Commission has pledged itself to work on this list and has also said it is not something that can be done in a couple of days. We do not expect that either. What we do expect, however, is that the Commission will give us regular updates and that it has an approximate timetable for the accomplishment of this task. After all, it would be unacceptable if, in the meantime, we were plunged back into a situation in which the Commission had to write to the Member States to find out how the Directive on sewage sludge was being interpreted. We will have none of that! We must have a clear and unequivocal white list, and both committees - the Agriculture Committee and the Environment Committee - have reiterated that point. It naturally means a large investment of time and money in monitoring, which is why both committees have stated that manufacturers also have an obligation to provide evidence. This obligation involves furnishing precise details of the composition of compound feedingstuffs on request, and is designed to shift some of the burden of proof as well as to minimise the cost of monitoring in the Member States. We naturally have no wish to spend vast amounts of time and money on monitoring and to be constantly setting off to conduct inspections all over the place. So if we were to do what we intend, if we were to implement it quickly and then pass quickly through the codecision procedure too, that would certainly be a huge step forward, and I feel sure that we shall be very strong and united in our dealings with the Council.
costep_2000-02-18_2_3	Mr President, I abstained on the excellent report by Mr Viceconte even though it contains some excellent ideas and Bavaria, which I represent here, is one of the most attractive tourist regions in the European Union. I warmly invite you to spend holidays in Bavaria and neighbouring Austria as often as you can. But apart from that I wanted to say that I do not like the centralist approach adopted in the Commission’s communication. I believe we need more decentralisation, more regionalism and less bureaucratic and centralist decision-making, especially in tourism policy. That is why we should not get drawn into a centralist EU tourism policy.
costep_2011-06-08_7_651	Even though the European Parliament’s report on Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe contains many ideas that should be supported, I did not support it because I believe that it damages the European Union’s image in the eyes of its residents. The report suggests increasing the tax burden on European citizens, and I cannot agree to that. One can agree that Europe must have its own finances and that this can be done by tax collection. However, this would require the creation of a federal Europe, which should be done through open debates, and not through the back door using tax policy. If we wish to continue in this direction, we must first ensure that Member States agree to renounce their tax revenues for the good of the European Union, and only then would it be possible to create a self-financed common budget. To make this type of decision, European politicians must involve society, which has not happened in this case.
costep_2010-02-24_17_15	Mr President, I am pleased that the European Parliament has succeeded in producing a resolution on the Goldstone report that has fairly broad support without simply transferring the conflict in the Middle East to Brussels. If we want to retain the chance of lasting peace, we must appeal to what unifies all parties involved, instead of - as some are doing here - emphasising the sources of division. The source of unification is the applicability of international law, in particular, with regard to human rights, throughout the world. However, just as the parties to the conflict must allow and support an independent investigation, the international community must avoid making a one-sided judgment. Therefore, we also need to make it absolutely clear that the one-sided demonising of Israel is not only inappropriate in this debate, but it is inappropriate in general. Those powers that are working to call into question the legitimisation of the State of Israel must be clearly repudiated by us in Europe. Instead, the powers in Israel that are fighting with us for peace, tolerance and human rights in the Middle East must be strengthened. It therefore needs to be made clear here and now that we find the obstruction of the NGOs in Israel by government representatives like the Foreign Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, unacceptable. This policy is harmful to the people of Israel and therefore to peace in the Middle East.
costep_2009-12-17_8_31	It was somewhat unenthusiastically that I voted in favour of the 2010 budget, since it is no match for the challenges that we have to face, not only in this context of serious economic and social crisis, but also in view of the fight against climate change. My main aim, with my vote, was to prioritise support for the European recovery plan, for the launch of a new initiative on micro-credit (EUR 25 million in 2010) and for emergency aid for the milk sector (EUR 300 million). In future, it is the effectiveness of the EU budgetary framework that we will have to review in order to equip ourselves with collective resources for action that are genuinely in keeping with reforms.
costep_2011-06-22_15_39	Madam President, Commissioner, Parliament, the Commission and the Council all agree in that the budget of the CAP should be appropriate and should be maintained at least at the current level. It is important to keep the two-pillar structure, to maintain direct payments and especially the strong rural development policy, and to improve competitiveness and strengthen environmental awareness. Innovation, research and development are of key importance as well. Environmental public goods and technologies that reduce the effects of climate change and enhance biodiversity and water management should be the focus of rural development. Further financial assistance is needed in the future as well to help new Member States close the gap and ensure that they can access rural development aid with better co-financing conditions post-2013, as well. It is important to provide equal competitive conditions and equal opportunities for the new Member States from 2014. And finally, it is important not to play off large farms and small-sized producers against each other.
costep_2005-09-08_1_37	Mr President, I will keep my speech to two minutes. Tourism today is an undisputed promoter of development, and it is also a key part of our development policy. It boosts employment, standards of living, health, and the infrastructure of many developing countries. I wish to raise three points. The first is that we need cross-border cooperation between the EU and the developing countries, between the countries of Africa and the developing countries, and cooperation too within the countries themselves. This requires cooperation between the public and the private sector. The second point is that, in my opinion, we need rules based on sustainable development. We have to pay attention, as many have already done in their speeches earlier on, to the matter of combating and weeding out child sex tourism. I think we would do well to earmark financial assistance for this. It is very much a matter of enlightening people’s attitudes both in the West and elsewhere. My third and last point is that we should invest in loans of cerebral capital, by which I mean people are sent from Europe to the developing countries to help promote economic growth, although in such a way that always takes account of the country’s own standpoint, the country’s special features, and the country’s culture. I spoke for two minutes.
costep_2011-03-24_7_222	The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), established on 1 January 2011 by the 24 November 2010 regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council, is designed to help maintain the stability of the financial system of the European Union by safeguarding the integrity, transparency, efficiency and orderly functioning of financial markets, and by strengthening investor protection. ESMA has appointed Mrs Ross, a German former economist at the Bank of England, as its first Executive Director. The European Parliament should vote in favour of this nomination in order for it to come into effect. For my part, I voted in favour of Mrs Ross' nomination.
costep_2004-02-12_1_80	Mr President, Commissioner, we are extremely concerned about the Commission’s strategy in relation to services of general interest. First of all, we condemn the lack of transparency, and also of respect, towards civil society and Parliament. In fact, in relation to services of general interest, the Commission has carried out consultations throughout 2003, but they were separate consultations. The Competition DG has produced a package on financial compensations, which I only know about through journalists, and essentially these texts completely ignore the advice and requests of our Parliament. Financial compensation is essential to the very existence of services of general interest. Any intrusion by the Commission in the field of definitions and rules justifying compensations would be unacceptable, since it is outside of its competences. The Commission’s role is to apply the law, not make it. Another reason for Parliament’s call for a legal act under codecision which would include the principles of funding is to clarify the Treaties and case-law. In this regard, only codecision would allow us to achieve a legitimate and viable compromise. Therefore, in the White Paper, which it must publish before April, the Commission must give a clear ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to this demand for a legislative act. By saying ‘no’, by not responding clearly and by assuming the right to impose substantial definitions and rules, it would be committing an abuse of power. For the moment, on the basis of the information available to me, I note that, in the package under preparation, it assumes it has the power to lay down rules, and that many of these choices formally contradict the European Parliament’s resolution. The resolution we adopted on 14 January of this year states that 'the task at Community level for services of general interest is to guarantee their exercise within the internal market and, notably, to ensure that competition rules are compatible with public service obligations'. But I believe that the Monti package, which I have not seen, makes funding possibilities more difficult, in the name of full respect for competition rules. I would insist, under these circumstances, and we have already told you this - I remember in particular the speeches by Mr Langen and Mrs Flautre, last year - on the fact that we do not want a new communication on the interpretation of the Treaty and jurisprudence. We want the Commission to prepare a legislative act involving the codecision procedure. However, the Commission is competent in the field of the application of rules. It is therefore entitled to prepare a decision and a framework, but these executive acts depend, as we all know, on the interpretation of rules. That is why we are asking you to say explicitly today, when you have corrected them following consultation, that these texts under preparation will only enter into force provisionally, while we await the adoption of a legislative act. I would now like to draw your attention to the substance of the Monti proposals, which contradict our resolution. Far from increasing legal certainty, they will worsen the uncertainty. Many services of general economic interest, in particular social, which did not previously notify, would now have to notify. For the acceptance of compensation, the requirements for tendering procedures will be toughened up. Our requests for criteria for the calculation of costs are being ignored. The notion of over-compensation would be greatly extended. As for services provided essentially to companies, they would be considered not to be included in the notion of service of general economic interest, which would represent a blatant intrusion into the field of definitions. So here are my questions. What is the Commission’s timetable for action? Will you respond coherently to the consultation and the proposals on compensations in the White Paper that we asked you to present here in April? Will you state clearly yes or no to a legal act through codecision? Will you state that your executive texts are of a provisional nature while we await the adoption of the corresponding legal act?
costep_2008-02-18_19_13	Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, the blatantly racist comments made by Mr Silvio Berlusconi last week, in which he called for zero tolerance towards Roma, illegal immigrants and criminals, are shocking and unacceptable. In a statement yesterday, Mr Francesco Storace, who is running for mayor of the Italian capital, spoke of 'denomadising' Rome, thereby making it clear that Roma have no place in the eternal city. Can these statements be happening just 18 days after the European Parliament adopted a resolution on a European Strategy on the Roma? I would ask my fellow Members from Italy to explain to their colleagues at home why it was that we supported this resolution, the objectives it contains that we formulated together, and why abusing Gypsies is inappropriate in the 21st century. The open letter published by me in connection with these anti-Romani statements was signed by a total of 72 Roma non-governmental organisations including 33 in Italy, 12 in Hungary, 9 in Macedonia, 4 in Romania, 3 in Turkey, 2 in Moldova, 5 in Bulgaria, and 2 in France. Thank you.
costep_2011-06-09_5_40	Madam President, Commissioner, unlike the French Government, I sincerely hope we will have a major public debate. We need comprehensive stress tests. Fukushima has shown that we must imagine the unimaginable. The method currently used fails to take into account risks such as terrorist attacks or plane crashes, and therefore does not meet this requirement. We need a transparent debate, because the choice whether to continue or stop must be based on broad public consensus that is informed but not bypassed by expert discussions. We need an independent debate in the presence of all parties, so as to avoid potential conflicts of interest and promote appeasement. Finally, I am from Alsace and therefore know the extent to which the Fessenheim nuclear power plant concerns our German and Swiss neighbours. Instead of establishing full national control over these issues, why not at least encourage a sharing of expertise between our security agencies? Security would benefit, as would transparency and citizenship at European level.
costep_1999-02-11_4_29	Mr President, we believe that of all the European institutions, the Council of Ministers and, to a greater extent, the European Council, possess the greatest relative legitimacy because people see their elected representatives meet in these institutions at the highest level. No other European institution has achieved such status, neither the European Parliament, which is still considered to be a lower House, nor, of course, the Commission, which is considered to be a mere collection of civil servants. In the very interests of Europe, attention must be focused on the most legitimate institution. Therefore, the Council must be granted the right to propose legislation and exercise control over the Commission, even censure it. Also, decisions must be taken unanimously for all major issues. In this respect, the Bourlanges report asserts that 'unanimity is an arrangement fundamentally inappropriate to effective decision-making '. In the explanatory statement, the rapporteur presents some gloomy calculations showing that with 15 players, the probability of achieving a unanimous position is one in 32 769. This is quite clearly wrong, because in today’s Europe, a great many decisions are taken every day by general consensus. In fact, the system of unanimous voting forces each partner to respect the point of view of others and endeavour to understand that point of view in order to negotiate better. The decisions taken as a result are more valid because they are based on mutual consensus. It seems as though this system is perhaps somewhat slower than others that are more authoritarian in nature, but it nonetheless produces good results. An enlarged Europe with 25 or 30 members should be able to operate in this way. We also reminded you, through an amendment, that the Luxembourg compromise should be incorporated into all parts of the Treaty. Unfortunately, that amendment was rejected. In any case, we have to accept that a Europe with 25 members cannot be monolithic and must obey the model of variable geometry. All of these measures, including the variable geometry which will make decisions on European cooperation more flexible, will strengthen the link between Europe and its nations.
costep_2003-06-18_3_14	Mr President, almost 20 years after the European Parliament, elected by universal suffrage, produced a draft Constitution, the 'Spinelli draft', we are achieving a text for a Constitution for a European Union made up of 25 States and 480 million citizens. I believe we must welcome this historic success of the Convention, which has produced a democratic draft whose contents largely correspond to the hopes we had placed in this enterprise. I would first of all like to express my gratitude for the work done by the European Parliament’s Delegation led very competently by the two Members who have represented it in the Presidium: Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Hänsch, who have acted as a coherent team fighting from the front but also protecting their rear. I believe that this has added coherence and seriousness to our representation and has helped our political families from throughout the enlarged Union to be able to work and mature in this House - which is the home of democracy in Europe - and to be able to create a common doctrine which has been specifically reflected in the text. Without making a very detailed analysis and assessment - this is a job we will have to do during the summer and which will have to be carried out by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs - and in passing, Mr President, I would like to complain on behalf of my group because Mr Napolitano has not been given speaking time as Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. He will speak within the speaking time allotted to the Socialist Group, but I do not believe that this is a correct way of proceeding. I would like to say on behalf of my group that we must celebrate the fact that we have a single text without options, without red cards; a text which opens doors and does not close them, and also one which is of a manageable size. I believe these are important elements on the basis of which we must work and make progress. We must defend what we have fought for tooth and nail and we must continue working; our two representatives have given a brief summary of what has been achieved. I would like to point out, in relation to the evolutionary clauses and the new date of 2009, that we must continue to work, drawing conclusions, creating doctrine and strengthening the European institutions. I would like to mention certain points which the Socialist Group sees as absolute priorities: to strengthen the social Europe and to defend Europe in terms of its economic governance, making progress in the field of taxation with regard to the internal market and majority decision-making in the field of foreign, security and defence policy; and we believe that this must also contribute to finding a better balance within the interinstitutional triangle. Our job must therefore now be to try to consolidate this Constitution as a basis for subsequent work, but we must work on the basis of what we have agreed, what has been achieved, which is an indication that we are able to act, and this is tremendously important at a time when the European Union was being portrayed as moribund and incapable of taking action. Furthermore, I believe we must welcome something which is also very positive, at a time when we have observers from the future member countries, and that is that they have participated fully in the work of the Convention before actually joining the Union. They are working shoulder to shoulder with us and playing a significant role, and this is being demonstrated in popular referendums. Over the last week we have had two significant successes in Poland and in the Czech Republic demonstrating that this is not just a market, but a shared project of coexistence, and we believe we should welcome it when so often distrust has been called for. Finally, Mr President, please allow me to comment on an important aspect, because we always talk about architecture and we must also talk about personalities, we must also support - and I would ask that this be done in Thessaloniki - the Council’s Agreement returned this week on the Statute on European Political Parties. I believe that Parliament has done significant work. We must thank the rapporteur, Mr Jo Leinen, for the great work he has done. It is clear that having protagonists who genuinely demonstrate that we are capable of organising ourselves is a fundamental element of European construction. And finally, Mr President, I would like to ask you on behalf of my group, when you go to the Thessaloniki Summit, to express the clear will of the whole House that the text which has been produced openly and democratically be respected, and also to say, on our behalf, that we want to be properly represented in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference; not just making use of previous experiences but with a representation which is in line with our participation and our dignity.
costep_2010-03-25_11_177	The report of the Committee on Development on the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation rightly notes that in the last two years, there has not been just one crisis, but a whole series of related crises. Instead of resulting in a reduction in development aid for developing countries, this situation should cause an increase. The common objective should be to allocate 0.56% of gross national income to development aid by 2010, and 0.7% by 2015. Apart from temporary aid, other measures are also needed which will change the architecture of world economic governance. This explains my support for the immediate fulfilment of obligations undertaken at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh on the matter of a shift in the IMF quota share to emerging and developing countries of at least 5%, and an increase of at least 3% in voting power in the World Bank for developing and transition countries. These measures should be correlated with action to end tax havens. An important solution for the financial system, the introduction of which is worth considering, too, is what is known as the Tobin tax. Taking into account the fact that the Committee’s report contains all the above-mentioned proposals, I decided to vote in favour of its adoption.
costep_2011-03-09_6_32	Mr President, the events taking place in the Arab world, and in all the countries in the Arab world, are a beautiful dream that is coming true. However, so as to prevent this dream from becoming a nightmare, we have to play our part and ensure that these peoples not only rid themselves of their dictators, but eradicate dictatorships too. This requires that they undergo a transition phase, which calls for massive assistance from our end. It is true that we have all forged relationships with these countries and their regime. However, once we witnessed the shocking violence being carried out, we spoke out with one voice, against the violence and against the regime that is inflicting it. The next step is to quash this violence, not only using words, but through our actions. Every day that passes and which brings violence with it is another day where we will have allowed murder to take place and blood to be shed. We must strengthen the European Union’s humanitarian presence. This is already being done, and Cathy Ashton is doing a good job, but we must increase our humanitarian aid, both towards the Libyan people, as well as those who are fleeing the regime towards Tunisia and Egypt. Moreover, if this influx makes its way towards Europe, then we must be prepared. It is all very well to claim that we should open our doors to Libyan refugees, yet it still remains to be seen whether we will all shoulder the responsibility if the situation arises.
costep_2007-09-05_8_4	The report states that approximately 110 billion tonnes/km of dangerous goods - dangerous for the population and the environment - are transported annually within the EU, accounting for almost 8% of total transportation of goods. Of those, 58% are transported by rail, 25% by air and 17% by inland waterways. The international transportation of dangerous goods is regulated by international agreements. In that context, we believe that the useful and necessary cooperation at EU level must safeguard the full sovereignty of the Member States as regards the transportation of (dangerous) goods within their territory, for example by means of the right to regulate, to issue individual authorisations and forbid the transportation of dangerous goods, notably for reasons of national security or environmental protection. This is a matter of principle that is all the more important in the context of the unbridled liberalisation of transportation promoted by the EU.
costep_2010-04-21_5_15	Mr President, the United States is the only world superpower today. It is an absolute and multidimensional superpower - cultural, military and economic. We are fortunate that this superpower is friendly to us and is based on the same values and foundations upon which the European Union is built. Therefore, we should appreciate this and support the United States in the noble cause of the fight against terrorism, because Western Europe in particular was protected by the US from communism for many decades. It was only thanks to the US that free Europe was free for 40 years. Today, the United States is giving very strong support to the whole free world so that the world can be free from terrorism. A comparison between the United States and the European Union of the efforts, financial outlays and technology devoted to the fight against terrorism is embarrassing for European states and the European Union. Therefore, if we can do something to help the United States in the fight against terrorism - and this is how I see this agreement - we should not hesitate. We should, of course, respect the principles of which we have been talking, but that, as I see it, is a question of cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament. What is required of us today is an expression of the political will to enter into such an agreement. I think such political will should be present here. The United States should enter into a treaty agreement with the European Union which will be both friendly and based on partnership.
costep_1997-04-10_6_48	Madam President, the recent riots in the Chinese province of Eastern Turkestan when the Chinese authorities executed a large number of Uighurs confirm once again what a terrible reputation China has when it comes to respecting human rights. The recent history of Eastern Turkestan is sadly a very typical example of this. The Uighurs have suffered badly under the Communist regime: many were transported during the 1960s, and tens of thousands were executed during the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s. Recent events in Turkestan are also further proof of the Chinese authorities' contempt for freedom of religion. More than 100 Koran schools have been shut down, and many Islamic priests have been arrested. According to a report by the American human rights organization Human Rights Watch/Asia, the Chinese Government regards anyone with religious beliefs as a potential security risk. It is convinced that what it calls 'hostile foreign elements' are using religion to destabilize China and overthrow the government. The Muslims in Eastern Turkestan are not the only victims of this religious policy: Christians attached to churches which are not officially registered are persecuted throughout China. In view of these serious human rights violations, it is absolutely deplorable that the countries of the European Union cannot manage to table a joint resolution at the United Nations condemning China. I therefore support the courageous step taken by the Danish Government, and I would point out that the fact that the Chinese Government actually thanked France for its positive attitude should give the French Government some food for thought.
costep_1998-03-12_6_18	Mr President, on the eve of the negotiations for a cooperation agreement with Cambodia two years ago, I expressed the hope here that our support would take on a kind of conflict preventative role in the country. But, as you know, Mr President, the international efforts were of no avail. The situation is escalating; there are summary executions, and refugees. Clearly there is no future in trying to influence from the outside a country which is still struggling to recover from genocide and which is suffering from a trial of strength between members of the royal family and those of a different political persuasion. That is why, under the current circumstances, it is not a very good idea to allocate ECU 9.5 million for the elections. This strikes me as throwing money down the drain. It would be much better if, at the coming summit in London, the leaders of ASEAN give a signal together with the EU. This does not mean that the human rights organizations and the refugees do not thoroughly deserve our support, however.
costep_2009-03-23_17_10	Mr President, as chairman of the Ad-hoc Delegation for Relations with the Pan-African Parliament, I would like to take the opportunity today to thank the many people involved. First of all, I would like to thank Maria Martens, who has prepared an excellent report on progress made regarding the agreed EU-Africa Strategy. Secondly, I would like to thank the institutions involved. We have managed, within the framework of a hexalogue - that is, involving six interlocutors - to reach an understanding between the two Parliaments. Both Commissions have agreed, as have the two Parliaments as well as the two Councils. As far as the Council is concerned, I would specifically like to single out the legal service, which is always particularly important when it comes to such matters, as common positions sometimes fail here. However, following the first meeting in Adis Ababa, we have managed, in our second meeting today, to implement and finally agree on what we had agreed concerning the involvement of the two Parliaments. I would like to comment on what Mr Hutchinson said. What is really happening? Yes, many bad things are happening in Africa. However, my impression - and perhaps this is coincidental - is that, since the agreement of this common strategy, Africa has reacted differently to coups. In Mauretania, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Madagascar, Africa has reacted by suspending the membership of these countries. That did not happen in the past. Back then, it would have been business as usual. In this regard, I would also like to state that we, as European governments, should also take these facts into account. If this partnership is based on common values, then the Europeans also have to react when Africans react when something goes wrong in Africa. That is why I am confident that if we, as Parliaments, are more involved in the implementation of this strategy in the future, we will be able to deliver added value to this partnership.
costep_2002-04-11_4_115	Mr President, Nigeria has ratified a number of international conventions on human rights, in particular the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. Despite this, however, here we are once again discussing the violation of women’s rights, pointing out that the death penalty still exists in Nigeria, declaring that current practice and the countless regulations contained in the new codes of criminal procedure of the Sharia continue to further the severe violation of human rights, even to the point of enforcing the death penalty. We, together with many men and women of democratic countries, have roused ourselves to action, and that is what saved the lives of Safiya and of Hafsatu, but, despite this victory, the Islamic court in Bakori has condemned another woman, Mrs Amina Lawal, to being stoned to death. Now, I do not feel we can continue - although we must do so - to discuss these massacres. We must demand that Nigeria, which is preparing for democratic elections and must therefore be supported by the European Union, not merely - as has been mentioned in the context of the Cotonou Agreement - consolidate pluralist democracy and social and economic justice, but that it put an end to these violations too. I feel that we can no longer be content with just discussing the ongoing violations and waiting for something to happen. We must be more resolute and take action using all the tools available to us.
costep_2002-09-02_1_40	Mr President, my thanks go to Mrs Corbey for an excellent report. The Sixth Environmental Action Programme approved the principle that the volume of waste generated should be de-coupled from economic growth. This is also one of the most important environmental policy objectives of the summit currently being held in Johannesburg. Indeed, this directive on packaging waste is just part of this problematic issue, but it is now a matter of debate for us here, and we should also bear in mind this higher goal whilst considering it. For this reason, in any revision of the 1994 directive ambitious targets must be set, as the rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, has also stated. What the Committee finally decided was not quite what the Social Democrats and the rapporteur wanted; hopefully, however, we will be able to hold to that target of a 10% reduction in the generation of waste. The environmental impact of the use of packaging waste actually requires a lot more research. It is not wise to establish any rigid hierarchy with regard to re-use and recycling; in some countries recycling works better, whilst in some regions re-use is more effective. For example, in Finland the re-use of soft drinks and beer bottles works excellently, and must therefore be encouraged, but in a way that allows everyone to be involved in this system openly. Research into environmental impact should lead to the establishment of environmental indicators for packaging. When we discussed this directive with various parties, we noticed that there are just as many experts as there are interested parties associated with the materials. We must definitely have data based on research regarding which materials improve the state of the environment most and in which circumstances. For there to be genuine competition between materials, in addition to the targets associated with materials I think there should also be a general aim where competition would be based on bringing more packaging materials that fulfil environmental criteria onto the market. Recycling is also an excellent solution when talking of sustainable development as a combination of social, economic and environmental policy. It creates jobs and helps the excluded in this sense, and it improves the state of the environment.
costep_2000-11-15_9_9	Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the BSE crisis has turned into a case of collective paranoia. The justified mistrust of consumers threatens the entire beef sector and the spectre of ruin haunts our livestock producers and small artisanal enterprises. This has come to pass because the incompetence of governments has been aggravated by our own inability to respond to the twofold challenge before us: the health challenge and the economic challenge. I will not detail the horrors that have been committed on all sides. I find the debate that is underway in this Chamber, which consists in finding out which institution out of the Council, the Commission or Parliament has done the most and which the least, rather unnecessary. The reality is something else. The facts stand, and they are appalling. We were aware of the dangers of animal meal, we were aware of the dangers of specified risk materials. The scientific authorities clearly stated that the development of the disease in cattle was not under control and they pinpointed the alarming growth in the numbers of animals affected. I believe that the Commission has failed miserably. The labelling of beef that was agreed on, which is a minimum form of labelling and only came into force two and a half months ago, does not make it possible for the origin of animals to be adequately traced, and we were very slow to ban specified risk materials. The management of the crisis has been terribly poor, and there were tragic shortcomings in our ability to anticipate the foreseeable consequences of the crisis. Where are the programmes to reduce the deficit of proteins in the European Union, to which reference was made a few moments ago? Where are the programmes to incinerate animal meal and animal waste and to implement obligatory testing throughout the European Union? The truth is that this is a problem affecting the European Union as a whole, not just a single country. The truth is that food quality has been sacrificed on the altar of productivity, the standardisation of lifestyles and flavourless products. Consumers used to have doubts about quality; today they worry about their own health. Our citizens know - because we cannot lie to people with impunity - that the crisis is serious. They know that if we are discovering sick animals in France, it is because we are looking for them, as was said earlier. We need far-reaching measures to be adopted at a national and European level if we want to avoid economic bankruptcy and a major health scare. We need to adopt the proposals put forward by the President-in-Office of the European Council, especially those banning animal meal in feed in all sectors of animal production. But we also need two additional, comprehensive plans, and I am calling for their immediate implementation, because any delay through hesitation would exacerbate the health and economic risks. The measures adopted by the French Government in this regard are, as I said, inadequate. Firstly, as others have said before me, we must have systematic screening of all cattle slaughtered for consumption by European citizens. For more than a year, the European authorities have been examining three screening tests, including the French test, which is deemed to be the most reliable and the most sensitive. This test can be developed on an industrial scale very quickly. It has to be done, without hesitation and without delay, and on a massive scale. Just now, I heard reference being made to random tests. Random tests are not going to restore consumer confidence, or producer confidence for that matter. Public opinion must be fully informed of the characteristics of the test I am talking about. The French screening test for BSE was developed at the CEA (a public-sector research institute). In June it was assessed by Directorate General 24 of the European Commission, which is responsible for consumer protection, and, in July 1999, it was transferred to an industrial partner. This test was developed with a view to protecting the consumer, so that it could be extensively used in slaughterhouses, thus preventing animals dangerous to human health entering the food chain. The results of the European assessment, which were published in July 1999, suggest that it is 10 to 300 times more sensitive than the three other tests assessed at the same time. A new study undertaken in September 2000 has been evaluated by the European Commission. It confirms the preceding results in terms of sensitivity. The sensitivity of this test guarantees that contaminated animals cannot possibly enter the food chain. The result of the examination can be obtained within 5 hours, and the test can be made widely available, as hundreds of millions of samples a year can be produced easily. Its immediate widespread use in the veterinary laboratories of the French departments would simply require the allocation of sufficient human resources until it can be automated. The test exists, it is reliable, and it can be carried out on a massive scale. I hope I have convinced you that it needs to be done. Secondly, Community farming needs to be reorganised to put our set-aside lands back into production so that we can grow soya, alfalfa and peas, which will give us the replacement proteins we are lacking and which will feed our animals much better than American GMOs. We sacrificed our soya, alfalfa and peas in the course of the COM negotiations in Marrakech. Well, the thing with poor agreements is that they should be challenged, especially when public health dictates this. By displaying courage and ambition, we can combine the health interests of Europeans and the economic interests of our producers, and thereby restore confidence. This will only be possible if there is no longer any doubt in the public mind, in other words, if screening is, as I would insist, systematic. Unless there is mandatory general testing, confidence will not be restored, for confidence cannot be restored by decree; it has to be earned. These are the reasons why my group has signed the motion for a resolution which will be presented to this House tomorrow, which, I hope, will be adopted with, if not a unanimous vote, at least a very large majority, so that everybody can be made aware that this Parliament is in direct touch with the problems affecting European citizens. Applause from the UEN Group
costep_2002-03-13_3_78	Mr President, this a bit simpler than just now. It is just about correcting something. The intention of Amendment No 162, a joint PSE and PPE-DE amendment, is to bring what we agreed for electricity in line with what we are now agreeing on for gas. It is word for word what we agreed earlier on for electricity. But because of the way the voting list works, that means that we first have to vote against the committee’s amendment and then vote for Amendment No 162. However, a mistake has crept in along the way. This is exactly what we agreed for electricity on Article 8(5). Amendment No 162 now also reads Article 8(5). However, for gas it is not Article 8(5) but Article 7a(1), and so of course that needs to be inserted there from the Minutes; this is just a technical adjustment.
costep_1999-02-24_10_3	Mr President, on behalf of the Agriculture Committee, I would like to congratulate Werner Langen on the excellent work he has done, on the balance he has demonstrated, and on the common sense he has displayed in presenting an amendment requiring excise duties to be examined every four years instead of every five years. We welcome his committee’s proposal. But, my goodness, here we are talking about tobacco taxes when a large proportion of these taxes are not even collected in the European Union. The truth is that, like alcohol, tobacco has an irresistible attraction for organised crime. And anyone who was present at the Committee of Inquiry on Community transit, anyone who regularly reads UCLAF reports or anyone who keeps abreast of current affairs in my own country, where 70 containers of tobacco disappeared just the other day, with the Portuguese Government claiming 14 billion escudos in compensation from a transport company, will know just how many millions escape the Community’s financial checks. And this often happens with the connivance of the Member States and also of certain European institutions, as funding for scanners for border checks and for physical checks at ports is often not granted. Nevertheless, I think we should be talking about taxes. But it would also be advisable for the Commission to think about how it checks the payments due to it and how it could force defaulters to pay up. Another omission I identified in the Commission document was the lack of a programme to educate young people about tobacco. They are the smokers of the future.
costep_2011-05-12_13_319	Today, Parliament adopted an important decision on antibiotic resistance. In my opinion, it is very important to collect and analyse information on the use of animal health products, including antibiotic substances. It is also necessary to ensure that these products are used effectively and moderately and do not pose a risk to the effectiveness of measures for combating human illnesses when antibiotic agents are chosen as a treatment in medicine. Although, from 2005-2009 in the EU, tests for monitoring the residues of antibacterial agents in animals and animal foodstuffs show positive results, we can still say that there is no controlled trend towards reduction, only fragmented fluctuations. Particularly worrying is the fact that according to 2009 data, the majority of discrepancies as regards antibiotic agents were found in honey, rabbit and farmed fish samples, in other words, products that are frequently considered to be valuable foodstuffs and are often used in Europeans' daily diet. Thus, the aim of carefully applying antimicrobial treatment and implementing comprehensive monitoring in order to better coordinate sources of human and veterinary research is very important for guaranteeing human health and animal welfare.
costep_2003-06-19_4_72	We support the United Nations' initiatives aiming to combat the illegal trade in weapons, including light weapons, which feed the traffic in arms and the profits of the major armaments industries. Significantly, however, I must highlight the fact - and the contradiction - that this debate took place in conjunction with the debate on a 'Security Strategy for the European Union', attended by Javier Solana, the High Representative for the CFSP, who had prepared a report for the Thessaloniki Council. Why? Because in his speech Mr Solana upheld a concept of security based on militarism and interventionism, arguing for the development of a strategy assuring an early, rapid and 'robust' intervention, when necessary, and the existence of more military resources in combination with diplomatic and civil instruments. This proposed 'Security Strategy for the European Union' seems to adapt the objectives of the CFSP and CESDP to the conclusions of the Washington and Prague NATO Summits in that it places the emphasis on the possibility of using military aggression. In other words, it is a consolidation of policies and instruments that are the negation of disarmament and détente in international relations and seek to guarantee worldwide military domination, through a hoped-for 'partnership' of the European Union with the United States.
costep_2010-10-20_7_359	Without rules or supervision, you cannot make any progress. Applying the rules that we have imposed upon ourselves during this time of crisis, to improve coordination and surveillance in economic matters, is the least we must ask of ourselves and of the Member States. In this vein, the report by Mr Feio allows us to focus on some considerable distortions, seeing how 'recent economic developments have shown clearly that economic policy coordination within the Union and, in particular, in the euro area, has not worked sufficiently well and that, despite their obligations under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), Member States have failed to regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern'. My vote is therefore, without doubt, in favour of the report.
costep_2002-09-24_2_125	Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Barnier for this recent communication on the evolution until 31 August 2002 of the budgetary implementation of the Structural Funds and of the outstanding appropriations. The fact that these same problems are being repeated calls into question once again the reliability of the budgetary forecasts. With regard to the 2003 budget, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism proposes increasing the maximum limit for payment appropriations, because in accordance with the amount corresponding this year to the multi-annual programming - EUR 27.5 billion - EUR 8.1 billion must be used for the RALs accumulated between 1994 and 1995, which is EUR 2.9 billion more than was forecast. We also ask that account be taken of the difficulties which will arise during the next financial year as a result of the application of the N+2 clause. Great effort will be required in terms of cooperation and control between Parliament, the Commission and the Member States. With regard to the pre-accession structural instrument, the ISPA, we must take up the Commission’s proposal, which means increasing the appropriations for this programme during the 2003 financial year to EUR 1 117 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 750 million in payment appropriations. It makes very little sense, when enlargement is about to take place, to weaken a useful and, above all, necessary instrument. In the budget we oppose the reduction in payment appropriations which the Council has made in relation to the Commission’s proposal on FEDER programmes and various Community initiatives. We must prevent them being insufficient to cover the commitments in the near future. It is better to anticipate these problems than to regret them at a later date. I would also like to say that we are worried about the scant support, especially in the budget, we believe there is for transport safety systems.
costep_2000-04-12_10_14	Mr President, the European Commission’s Green Paper has caused many to reach for their pens, so much so that in the motion for a resolution, the objective of the Green Paper has been lost almost completely. Similarly, the intention of the rapporteur, Mr Kuckelkorn, who has carried out a vast amount of work, for which I would like to thank him, is not expressed very well in the motion for a resolution. It is now up to us to see that an acceptable document is produced tomorrow during the vote. The principal aim is for workers, when they move to another Member State, to be able to transfer their supplementary pension schemes and continue to pay into them without forfeiting their pension rights and with a guarantee that their accumulated pension rights will retain their value. Unfortunately, the Commission has not really made any headway towards fulfilling this wish. We have a long way to go before the compulsory transfer of value between Member States will be a reality. The first obstacle we need to negotiate is the mutual recognition of supervisory rules. It is then important that an adequate distinction is drawn between pension funds and commercial insurance companies. A pension fund has an obligation to be generally acceptable. A full-value pension scheme covers biometric risks. Insurance companies do offer their participants a choice, and their products do not cover biometric risks. Since the risks covered are not identical, government inspection will also vary for pension funds and insurance companies. On account of this supervision, complete freedom of investment is justified in both cases. This leads on average to higher returns. We need to avoid creating a situation where the individual is forced, on account of significantly lower returns on pension funds, to enter the wild investment woods in search of their supplementary pension schemes, where the big bad wolf is after their money. The second obstacle is the levying of taxes within the Member States. Taking into account the fast approaching ageing of the population, it is desirable for fiscal systems to promote the development of supplementary pensions. The EET model, where premium payments are tax-free and the retirement payout is taxed, meets this requirement and is also common in most Member States. I hope that Parliament and the Commission will make the internal market for supplementary pension schemes a reality along these lines.
costep_1998-11-18_14_9	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is another fresh start for a new stage in the race for peace in the Middle East. Hope, like the phoenix, has risen from the ashes, and yet the truth is that the main characters involved are hardly enthusiastic. We cannot say that they are welcoming each other with open arms. Urged by the President of the United States and already rejected by more than half its parliamentary majority, the Israeli Government is moving forward but dragging its feet. For its part, the Palestinian delegation, tired of having been deceived too many times and of being taken for a ride, no longer believes in the merits of dialogue. Nevertheless, the commitments made will actually have to be respected. The attacks and murders on all sides must stop, extremist settlers must no longer be urged to take provocative actions, deaths must cease and people must be prepared to look at, listen to and respect one another. We in Parliament must launch an appeal to our counterparts in the Knesset and the Legislative Council, above and beyond the Israeli Government and the authorities. Through our counterparts we must launch an appeal to the Israeli people, heirs of those who brought unprecedented and unequalled messages of knowledge and spirituality to the whole world. We must launch an appeal to the Palestinian people, where Christians and Muslims come together in the melting pot of a nation that is being born and whose birth is particularly painful. We must tell them not to be afraid, not to fear their neighbours or the world that is following their progress. Europe, although unfortunately still not involved in the diplomatic progress, is nonetheless very active and very much part of the construction of this country; this Europe is their brother and wants them as its new-born partners.
costep_1999-05-05_8_9	Mr President, it is on the strength of our convictions rather than any desire to put up opposition that we will not vote for the legislative resolutions on Agenda 2000, with the exception of the resolution on the COM in wine, as we do not support the positions of the Commission and the Council that emerged as a result of the Berlin compromise. How could we be pleased with an agreement that leads to a significant reduction in European farmers' incomes, through a partially compensated reduction in prices, before totally eliminating them to satisfy the requirements of the WTO? You will be aware, Mr President, that certain agricultural products are essential for the environmental balance and for the utilisation of EU territory. Unfortunately, a serious decline will be experienced as far as certain products are concerned. I am thinking, in particular, of oil protein crops, which, I would remind you, are ideal rotation crops to produce quality cereals, something we are increasingly trying to do. When I drafted the two opinions of the Committee on Agriculture on Agenda 2000, I warned all my colleagues about the budget difficulties we would encounter. In this connection, I am for the most part satisfied with the Berlin agreement with respect to its aim to support, if need be, the agricultural guideline as and when the successive enlargements take place, taking into consideration an automatic annual technical adjustment in the financial perspective to account for inflation. We only hope that the principle of compulsory expenditure will not be called into question. Apart from its repercussions on farmers' incomes, this agreement in no way prepares for the next WTO negotiations, or perhaps, without saying so, it prepares for them too well. All the proposed reforms will be given a pounding. The only acquis that our partners will accept is the reduction of prices. Clearly, our partners are also going to try to dismantle compensation aid. We all know that the motto in these types of negotiations is that everything that has been established has been established while the rest is up for negotiation. European agriculture must not disappear. Besides the economic and financial role that farmers play, they also have a social, cultural and environmental role that must be given top priority. On listening to Mr Prodi’s speeches, I noticed that he plans to use his position to enhance the role of the European Union in urban areas. So allow me to ask one question: in this context, where does the future of the countryside lie with the development of the Structural Funds to benefit urban areas, with the new WTO negotiations and with a CAP that contradicts our European identity?
costep_2002-02-07_10_2	Madam President, Commissioner, what has been going on in Guantanamo Bay? That section of the European intelligentsia whose approach is still marked by naïve optimism and which still believes that, after 11 September, we can respond to violence without using violence and to war without using weapons, has spoken out about the conditions in which al-Qa' ida fighters, captured in Afghanistan, were transported to Guantanamo Bay. Let us try to imagine what would happen if, in the light of the tragic experience of the revolt in Mazar-i-Sharif, the Americans had not taken all the necessary precautions to enable these fanatical fighters to be safely transported; fighters who, for years, have been trained to seek martyrdom by carrying out acts of the most mindless violence. Had they not been treated in this way and had they simply been collectively transported by aircraft, they would have become unbalanced and uncontrollable. What is going on now in Guantanamo Bay? All eyewitness reports testify that the prisoners are being treated well and that the injured are receiving all the care needed for their recovery. So, why is this urgent resolution now being tabled, given the wave of solidarity that Parliament voiced unanimously after the attacks? The only possible reason is so that we can, in the name of fine principles and grand sentiments, distance ourselves from the war that the Americans are continuing to wage against international terrorism. No, ladies and gentlemen, this war cannot be waged by applying international conventions, which were approved at a time when we needed to protect fighters engaging in traditional battles, and when civilians were not an automatic target, as they are now. The war waged by terrorists against defenceless people renders all the Geneva Conventions null and void. The essence of the war against terrorism resides, first and foremost, in collecting information, the aim being to prevent further attacks by infiltrating groups in order to destroy networks which, as we all know, still exist on our territory and in the United States. This is what the Americans are trying to do at Guantanamo Bay. We can only congratulate them on their efforts. That is why our group will not be associated with the joint resolution tabled by other groups, but we will table our own resolution, which, in essence, calls for a revision of international law so that we can adapt to the conditions of the new era that began in New York and Washington on 11 September 2001.
costep_2003-09-24_3_180	Mr President, I believe there have been many statements here condemning the recent comments of the Israeli Government and recent events. It is very easy to say to other people, to the Israelis and the Palestinians, what they must do, but perhaps we should consider what Europe is doing, what we are doing, because we can do something about that, because it is in our hands. In this regard, I did not like the comments of the Council, which has taken the bait, which has become embroiled in the current media war. Europe cannot depend on the media war, on statements and threats. We must work on what Europe is doing. In this regard, European policy has been rather ambiguous in recent months, because, if Europe played an important role in creating the figure of Abu Mazen, what has it done to support him? I would like to put this question to the Council, and also, and above all, to the Commission. What have we done to ensure that the Palestinians do their duties, such as to support Abu Mazen so that he may have a single police force or to demand that Arafat concede some of his powers to a minister who he himself had supported? What have we done in order to build a country able to accept its responsibilities as an independent and democratic state? What have we done to exchange our very nice NGO programmes, peace declarations, human rights groups, doves in schools, for a system and health services which are not managed by the Church or by a terrorist system like Hamas, which is paying doctors and teachers? There are more than 1 200 000 children lacking a proper education system. The question we should be asking is: what has Europe done to strengthen the system of security and justice? We condemn the wall, because it runs counter to any democratic system and is a physical and moral aggression, but we must also build the country and support the victims of terrorism. Europe must open a line of support for these victims. It must take a position and combat the prevailing ambiguity. Let us have a clear and effective policy in Europe, and not a policy of making statements.
costep_2007-06-19_19_5	Mr President, we had no difficulty in the Committee on Legal Affairs in dealing with the issue of the legal basis, because the aim of this measure is not the implementation of commercial policy - and Article 133 is not therefore applicable - but the protection of health - and Article 175 is therefore applicable. The Committee on Legal Affairs has therefore proposed that the sole legal basis be Article 175, with all of the consequences of that from a procedural point of view. Having said that, Mr President, as an MEP from a country that has very close historical links to mercury activities, I would like to point out that Mr Callanan’s Amendment 40 on the storage of mercury is much more precise than the text that the Commission had proposed with regard to Article 3(1a). Having proposed this legal basis, therefore, Mr President, I would also call for support for Mr Callanan’s Amendment 40.
costep_2009-01-13_18_2	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this report we wish to adopt the proposal for a Council decision on Convention 188 of the International Labour Organization (ILO) on work in the fishing sector, establishing minimum international standards that must be respected, and fairer conditions around the globe. In this way we will remedy the low rate of ratification of many conventions in the field of maritime labour. This Convention, adopted in June 2007 by the 96th session of the International Labour Conference, is aimed at establishing minimum international working standards for the fishing sector and promoting decent living and working conditions for fishers. It covers, amongst other things, conditions relating to such important issues as health and safety at work, manning and hours of rest, crew list, repatriation in case of problems, recruitment, placement of workers and social security. The professionals in this sector have been waiting a long time for the adoption of this ILO Convention on work in the fishing sector because they believe that it represents a step forward in dignifying this important strategic sector, in which some 30 million men and women work worldwide. In 2003, the ILO Office and its tripartite constituents began working on drawing up updated and comprehensive international labour standards for the fishing sector, aiming to provide appropriate protection for fishers around the globe, in view of the special nature of the sector and its specific living and working conditions. Taking into account that it is a sector with a high rate of fatal accidents - to which serious levels of exploitation and a lack of protection contribute - it requires special protection. This Convention also reviews other existing conventions on the sector, specifically on the minimum age, on the medical examination of fishermen, on their articles of agreement and on the accommodation of crews. It is accompanied by a Recommendation (No 199). It should be noted that this Convention became necessary after the adoption of the ILO consolidated Maritime Labour Convention in February 2006, which excluded the fishing sector from its scope. Therefore, we are calling for every effort to be made to ensure that the various Member States swiftly ratify the Convention, preferably before 2012, as it will enter into force once it has been ratified by 10 of the 180 ILO member countries, eight of which must be coastal states. However, it is equally important that its provisions be applied in places where they are not yet in effect. Finally, I would like to thank all those who helped to draw up this report, including my colleague Willy Meyer, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries. I hope that all my fellow Members inform their national parliaments and governments so that this Convention can be ratified as quickly as possible.
costep_2010-05-05_14_135	I voted for this resolution submitted by the Conference of Committee Chairs, which requests the Commission to submit new proposals for those dossiers which were pending in Parliament at the time of the Treaty of Lisbon’s entry into force and the procedure for which has lapsed. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for the 'Proposal for a Council Recommendation on measures to combat neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer’s, through joint programming of research activities', I support the invitation presented by the Conference of Committee Chairs to the European Commission to submit a new proposal on these dossiers so that Parliament is consulted in a manner appropriate to its institutional role also assigned by the provisions of the new Treaty.
costep_2003-07-02_3_33	Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I shall let you into a secret: I prefer your own emollient presentation to the contribution, here in Strasbourg yesterday, by the French Prime Minister, whose game was one of national division. That said - and I imagine you will have realised the fact in the course of this debate - we shall judge you by your actions and not by mere words. You will also be aware that Parliament has high ambitions for a successful IGC, and it is the task of your presidency to bring it about. That is the ambition of Parliament and of my political group, in the service of a European democracy that operates at all levels, be it at European level or in each of our Member States, a democracy that respects this Charter of Fundamental Rights that we have just incorporated into the draft Constitution. I have just, very belatedly, come across your programme in English - I do not, unfortunately, read Italian - and I see that there is again talk of Jacques Delors’s White Paper. I am delighted, because I think Jacques Delors was right. Since he proposed that the EU undertake this grand project of trans-border networks and European infrastructures, we are, quite simply, coming up against the same problem, namely that of funding. You raise the idea of funding by the EIB, but the EIB is still just a bank. You will find no solution other than a European loan. Are you prepared, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to fight for a European loan to fund this major work? Otherwise, it will be a case of just words, words, words. At the end of the day, does this reinvigoration plan serve the cause of European growth or simply that of the Italian economy as it struggles to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact?
costep_2001-06-14_2_2	Mr President, the two reports that I am presenting affect seven regulations, the reform of which we are debating, and which refer to the outermost regions of the European Union, that is, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Réunion and Guyana, part of France, the Azores and Madeira, part of Portugal; and the Canary Islands, part of Spain. Distance, internal dispersion and climate have been significant obstacles to their development. Distance and transport costs for imports and exports, and the small size of these territories have prevented them from attracting and benefiting from significant investment. Declaring its duty of Community solidarity in responding to the needs of these outermost regions, between 1989 and 1991 the European Community adopted some other action programmes due to their remote and island nature, called the POSEIs. The aim was to promote sustainable development and strengthen job-creating production sectors. This was done using the Structural Funds and by favourably adjusting common policies, particularly the CAP. Special aid was thus established for particular local products and the supply of raw materials was improved through specific supply arrangements included in the respective POSEIs. The favourable measures established by the Community have been combined with very significant efforts on the part of the Member States directly concerned: France, Portugal and Spain, and by the regional and local administrations. Considerable progress has therefore been made, but despite this, there are still inadequacies, which is why we need to maintain the measures, even improving the mechanisms to seek even more positive results. In any case, in order to continue to make progress in integrating these regions into the European area and in order to deal with phenomena that have appeared recently with the growing process of globalisation, we need to have a sounder legal basis and strengthen the regulations that have been operating up until now. We have been working on this for months, also relying on the fact that in Amsterdam, the recognition of the specific nature of the outermost regions and the commitment to support them in order to overcome their problems was introduced into the Treaties in Article 299. The reform plan that was presented to us was moving in the right direction, but it fell short in its proposals. For example, it did not propose the essential change to the legal basis in order to refer to the new text of the Treaties that I have just mentioned, but it was certainly a good starting point for our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to work on. The committee had better cooperation from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the latter in order to bring about the change in the legal basis. We also listened to the authorities and social sectors of the territories that we are dealing with and we thus arrived at a series of amendments that were debated and adopted in the committee proceedings. As well as the amendment on updating the legal basis, there are amendments that respond to joint demands from the different regions and others that are specific to each of them. Among the joint ones it is worth mentioning the possibility of these regions being able to export products produced with raw materials introduced to the islands under the SSAs with rights to refunds, the need to increase support for the livestock breeding sector and to boost agricultural and food SMEs. The amendments on specific sensitive products from each region concern tomatoes in the Canary Islands, livestock, milk products and the sugar industry in the Azores and the wicker industry in Madeira, and support for rice in some of the French territories. With these amendments we are expressing our will to overcome once and for all the problems of our outermost regions. They are not about subsidising economic and social backwardness in these territories, but about acting decisively to permanently overcome this backwardness and thus to offer those who live there living conditions and prospects for the future that are comparable to those of the rest of the citizens of the European Union. Besides, the costs of the improvements that we are proposing are certainly insignificant in the context of the budgetary proportions that the Union deals with. I will finish by thanking the officials of our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their dedication and professional attitude, and also by expressing my thanks to the Commission and the Council, who have supported us by showing interest and understanding. If, as I hope, Parliament adopts what the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is submitting for its opinion, it will be the Council of the Union that will have the responsibility of not disappointing our expectations, which are in fact those of the people of the Canary Islands, Madeira, the Azores, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Réunion and Guyana. Please bear in mind that it is in measures such as this that the confidence of citizens in the activity of the European Union is at stake, as is, in short, the credibility of our project.
costep_2011-01-19_7_92	I voted for this report in support of Europe’s citizens as it stipulates clearer rules regarding patients' rights to seek treatment abroad and the opportunity to make a choice which is based on their needs, not their means, and which must be informed and not made under duress. The directive stipulates the following principles: patients will be able to receive the non-hospital healthcare to which they are entitled in their own Member State in another Member State without prior approval and have their treatment costs reimbursed up to the ceiling established by their own healthcare system. Information is also a key issue. Therefore, each Member State will be obliged to maintain national contact points to inform patients about the availability of healthcare, administrative procedures, complaints, appeals and so on.
costep_2000-05-17_11_55	Firstly, I would like to express my satisfaction, both at the existence of Article 13 which has been mentioned, and for the action plan which the President-in-Office of the Council has referred to and which has been developed for the issue that we are considering today. However, since not everything in the garden can be rosy, I am not completely satisfied at the moment. It is true that Article 13 covers practically all possible - at the moment at least - forms of discrimination. However, subsequent regulatory development and the initiatives being proposed are incomplete and unbalanced. The President-in-Office of the Council has mentioned three examples and I would like to refer to them specifically. There are certain cases in Article 13 which are susceptible to discrimination, such as the one we are dealing with today, the case of disabled people, which I believe have been implemented in an irregular way. It is true that there are others which are still much less developed, such as discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. However, returning to disability, I believe that the European Union requires more complete legislation which covers every possible type, including cases of double disability. I would like to know the Council’s opinion - as well as that of the Commission - and I would like to know whether it is considering any initiative for cases such as, for example, women and disability, discrimination on the basis of gender and for the kind of disability involved in the case I have referred to.
costep_2002-05-14_2_99	The Torres Marques report is on European tourism. I can only vote for the motion, Mr President, in view of recital O of the report, which states that pensioners are to be considered as tourists who should be assisted. However, I would propose, Mr President, an ad hoc programme for promoting tourism among the elderly, which I would like to call the 'Ulysses senior programme'. Why this name? I am sure you will have read the Divine Comedy, Mr President, as we all have. The great Dante Alighieri writes in the Divine Comedy that, after crossing the Pillars of Hercules, Ulysses set off again across the sea for further adventure. Ulysses was certainly a pensioner when he crossed the Pillars of Hercules: after spending a whole lifetime fighting at Troy and getting home again afterwards he was an old man when he set out again. That is why I feel that there should be a programme promoting third-age tourism and that it should be called the 'Ulysses senior programme'.
costep_2011-02-02_14_15	Mr President, with regard to the thorough preparations for the energy summit and the political priority areas: Mr Reul, what then is your view of the fact that, in a major interview today in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in Germany, Mr Oettinger warned the European Union against setting too ambitious renewable energy targets? This comes only a few weeks after the Renewable Energy Directive, of which all of us here were very proud, entered into force. As regards thorough preparations on the subject of energy efficiency: what is your view of the fact that the energy efficiency action plan is still lying in a drawer and so there would in fact be absolutely no chance of debating it at the summit?
costep_2009-01-13_12_12	Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur, my colleague, Mr Coelho, for his contribution. He has already succeeded in achieving a compromise with the Council and the Commission at first reading and I strongly support that compromise, including the 'one person-one passport' principle. However, I would like to explore this issue in a little more detail. This principle should make it possible to offer greater protection against crimes such as child trafficking and child abduction, because every child should receive his or her own passport with a chip containing his or her biometric data. Of course, this will carry a price tag. This will certainly be the case in Member States which have until now allowed children to be included on their parents' passports. In the Netherlands, the maximum cost of a passport is upwards of EUR 48 and the cost of including a child on his or her parent’s passport is EUR 8.50. For a family with three children this will, therefore, result in a doubling of the cost of obtaining passports, from EUR 120 at present to more than EUR 240. Of course, every parent would happily hand over that amount if it contributed to their child’s safety. Yet is it not true that, if it is possible to abduct a child, it is also possible to get hold of his or her passport? Once the amended regulation is in place, it will no longer be possible to include children on their parents' passports. However, is it not the case that including a child on his or her parent’s passport in some cases actually serves the very interest of the child’s safety, as it indicates which parent has custody of the child? How will it then be possible to carry out effective checks of parental authority? Within the next three years the European Commission will have to review the need for an additional regulation, for example Community rules concerning the crossing of borders by children. At present, Member States are still fairly divided on this issue. I call on the Commission to use the review to examine whether or not and how the introduction of a single passport per person has contributed to a decrease in the number of child abductions. Has the current compromise produced the desired effect or has it merely led to side effects which require resolution? Commissioner, our children’s safety demands our permanent attention. Today we are taking one particular step. Should it be in the child’s interest to take further steps in the medium term, you will certainly find the Christian Democrats in this House on your side.
costep_2008-05-21_18_2	The main idea on which the Animal Health Strategy is based is that prevention is better than cure, which is obviously the case. I am sure we all recall the problems related to BSE and avian influenza, when it proved necessary to cull millions of animals. That was a most unpleasant experience, and I am sure none of us ever wish to see it repeated. It did, however, indicate to us that we should improve cooperation at European level in order to improve protection of animal health. The latter is very closely linked to human health, owing to the possibility of direct or indirect transmission of certain diseases from animals to human beings. I should like to single out several points in my report for particular attention. Firstly, the promotion of better standards for animal health care. The report strongly emphasises the close link between the two. It is to be hoped that both will be prominent in future policy. The second issue I wish to highlight is fair competition. European producers are required to comply with a great many veterinary standards, and with provisions relating to animal health and welfare. The same requirements are not imposed on importers, however. This is emphasised very strongly in the report. Our producers and those exporting animal products to the European market should all be subject to the same requirements. This represents a major challenge to our negotiators in the framework of negotiations at the World Trade Organization. My third point relates to strong support for the vaccination programme. We believe it is an important instrument with which to reduce the number of cases of disease. A new approach is required too. Products originating from vaccinated animals should not be discriminated against on the market. A number of paragraphs in the report have been devoted to this matter. My fourth point concerns the damages and compensation system. Firstly, this should encourage efforts to reduce the risk of disease. Secondly, it should cover not only losses directly related to eliminating the sources of disease but also indirect losses related to market crises. The fifth point is better control on the Union’s external borders. This should not be limited to controlling documents. It should involve thorough checks to effectively prevent the illegal entry of animals of unknown origin onto Union territory. The sixth point relates to the time of implementation of the strategy. I believe we cannot expect to have all these legislative arrangements in place as early as 2013. A longer time period is needed. The seventh point concerns financing the strategy’s aims. The draft report criticises the fact that the funding for these ambitious plans is inadequate. The plans should be properly financed from the Union’s budget. In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to say a few words in English, so that I can be faithful to the quotation I shall now refer to. The speaker continued in English
costep_2008-01-30_24_10	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation is to implement and administer cross-border, supranational and interregional cooperation measures. It is no exaggeration to say that this new network is intended to improve the quality of people’s everyday lives, to make our businesses more competitive, to extend the scope of our research and education centres and, last but not least, to preserve our environment. There is no compelling need for the EU to provide financial support for EGTC measures. This instrument will enable regional and local authorities to form cross-border alliances with their own legal personality - a significant innovation in terms of the scope for territorial cooperation. The EGTC offers a unique opportunity to generate synergetic effects that transcend the institutional framework and to guarantee better, coordinated investments and uniform and efficient use of resources. On 5 July 2006, as we know, this instrument was created by virtue of a European Parliament and Council Regulation. By 1 August 2007, all Member States were to have enacted supplementary legal and/or administrative provisions. The fact that only five or six Member States have adopted national rules gives us cause for serious concern. The losers will be the potential committed participants who want to foster cross-border cooperation with their good ideas and innovative projects. To that extent, the questionnaire was warranted, and we also urgently await information on this matter from the Council.
costep_2008-04-22_11_28	Mr President, the increase in the global population and the qualitative increase in consumption in developed countries has led to a major hike in food prices. This could have been foreseen. We should not be shocked by this. This problem can only grow, as population numbers will continue to increase and people in developed countries will be looking for good food with no genetic contamination, which will clearly cost significantly more. Meanwhile, instead of asking ourselves how we can bring down food prices in the EU, we are subsidising expensive agriculture in the old countries, while in the new accession countries we are supporting the cheaper production of healthy foods only to a limited extent, and this is obviously going to restrict any growth in production in these countries. Europe is faced with a great opportunity to level the negative foreign trade balance with such countries as China and India, as the standard of living in these countries is steadily rising and population numbers are rising hand over fist. They are going to need a lot more food.
costep_2002-12-17_2_75	Mr President, next Thursday at 3 p.m, I am going to meet Professor Alexis Valas and his students from the Robert Schumann University in the University of Strasbourg, who, having been informed of Mr Fatuzzo’s explanations of vote, have asked for a lesson on the subject. I will tell these students that I voted for the Damião report and called for precisely that for which they are going to ask me, namely for those who are exposed to asbestos in their workplaces to be authorised by Europe to work half a day only while being paid as if they were working full-time, with the cost of this being borne by all the other workers who have the good fortune to work in a healthier environment which does not put them at risk from serious illnesses such as asbestosis.
costep_2007-09-05_2_42	Madam President, in the global war on terror, the only way to ensure that fewer people die at the hands of ideological murderers is through good identification and assessment of terrorist threats. To this end we need a good and practicable European counter-terrorism strategy. The key to this strategy, in my view, is the creation of a European code of counter-terrorist procedure. I therefore welcome the Council’s initiative on this matter. Such a code is needed for reasons beyond simply harmonising the actions taken by Member States. It should also clearly define which measures are acceptable in the battle to prevent acts of terror. What we need, then, is the identification and detailed specification of situations in which the threat of terrorism is to be treated as a state of emergency, and mutual agreement on the use of certain concrete measures and certain legal measures, which will unfortunately restrict citizens' rights and freedoms in some areas. The reasoned restriction of citizens' freedoms is necessary, because without such restrictions we can tell the terrorists right now: we care more about your rights and freedoms than we do about the rights of the people you are killing in your attacks. It is also important to define the role of the counter-terrorism coordinator. We are faced with a choice: either we continue along the path of strengthening administrative competence and coordinating abilities, as during Mr de Vries’s time - although that path demands that we engage in some serious reflection and draw conclusions from what has happened over the past four years - or we should consider boosting the political profile of whoever holds this post. However, then the issue of competition with Javier Solana arises. One way or another, the decision we take on this cannot simply be based on personal views.
costep_2006-11-15_16_8	Mr President, the Greens appear to be learning. The chairman of the security and defence sub-committee has produced a report on military policy in the EU. The report has now been wrapped up in social democratic cotton wool, its language - originally unmistakeable - robbed of its punch. It is evident that no place could be found for the statement in the draft to the effect that the EU ought, under certain conditions, to be open to the concept of pre-emptive warfare; that sort of talk was, no doubt, too plain. The report makes the mistakes usually associated with a militarised EU foreign policy. It incorporates a risk analysis of the European Security Strategy, according to which the principal threats faced by the European Union and its citizens are international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, failed states and organised crime. What about poverty, hunger and social inequality? The report speaks up for military border surveillance - aimed against whom, I wonder? - and for the use of military means to secure access to resources. The EU wants to develop a strategic partnership with NATO; the report 'welcomes NATO’s increasing capability of playing a role in out-of-theatre operations' - and that in a report from the European Parliament! It also calls for a considerable strengthening of Europe’s operational capacities, including air and sea transport, and the conflation of civilian and military is taken still further. The report amounts to a catalogue of demands aimed at the further militarisation of the European Union - demanding, among other things, more money for crisis operations, which will have to be found from the Community budget, which means new financial arrangements. After the games played on us with Athena, what is now being proposed is the introduction of a virtual military budget. We all know that the Treaty of Nice, quite rightly, outlaws any freestanding military budget for the EU; that is why attempts are being made to resurrect the deceased EU constitutional treaty, for as it says, 'stresses the importance of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which will bring about major progress towards a Security and Defence Union'. It is for precisely that reason that we are opposed to this Constitutional Treaty for the EU. What is being called for here is the EU as a military union. There are those for whom making the EU a military union is a goal, and paragraphs 51 and 52 of this report read like their wish list, with new weaponry and more money to buy it and enable the EU to be a military global player around the world. That is the wrong way to go about things. The EU is currently involved in at least 11 military and police operations around the world, and more are in the pipeline; the list now includes Afghanistan, where NATO troops are killing more and more civilians, and now the EU wants to join in the carnage as soon as possible, when what is needed - and now! - is for the troops to be brought home from Afghanistan and elsewhere. The European Union has no need of more armaments; it needs to be a civil power. What is needed is disarmament, and it is needed right now.
costep_2000-03-15_3_28	We fundamentally reject the principle of allowing chocolate to be produced throughout the Member States using a percentage of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter. This is for reasons connected with safeguarding the legitimate interests of cocoa-producing countries and also reasons relating to consumer protection. It is quite clear that a step of this kind would inevitably have an adverse effect on cocoa-producing countries. Furthermore, and this is the key reason for our views, consideration has not even been given to a study on the impact of such a measure on developing countries that produce cocoa. At the same time, allowing up to 5% vegetable fats other than cocoa butter to be used in chocolate production sets a dangerous precedent, given that, in the long term, it may lead not just to the use of a higher percentage of these fats than set at present, but it may also open the way to chocolate being produced with other kinds of fat in future, including even genetically modified fats. Furthermore, it is clear that there is still no reliable method for testing the quantity of such fats used in chocolate production, whilst there is no requirement for clear, compulsory labelling which would, as a minimum, allow consumers to distinguish real chocolate, which only uses cocoa butter, from chocolate whose ingredients include other fats.
costep_2010-12-15_10_342	I approved of this report because it aims to increase energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2020, and thereby advance the transition to a sustainable and green economy. The advantages are huge in terms of both economic growth and job creation. The jobs created will be in both rural and urban areas. It is well known that there is a huge potential for energy efficiency in buildings. Therefore the focus should be on the renovation of existing buildings, since the construction rate of new buildings within the EU is in continuous decline and many old buildings have the greatest efficiency potential, if renovated properly. In the cleantech industry there is a need to bridge the gap between the USA and China, on one hand, and the EU, on the other. Both countries are far more progressive than the EU with regard to adopting legislative measures promoting energy-efficient solutions. Therefore, measures and instruments to boost financing should be supported by the EU and Member States. The creation of national energy efficiency funds which support Energy Performance Contracting should be incentivised through a financial instrument at European level. Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) whereby a customer purchases a guaranteed energy saving creates leverage as the investment is paid back over a time span of 2-15 years. Such a model creates jobs within SMEs, consumers save money on energy bills and emissions are reduced.
costep_2011-03-09_16_12	Mr President, the contrast is striking! The revolution, the change taking place in the Arab world is fascinating for all of us. We are trying to help. We have discussed Libya today. In recent days and weeks, we have discussed Egypt and Tunisia. Yet, at the same time, we have a standstill in the peace process. Against this backdrop, we must say quite clearly here, Baroness Ashton, that you did us a service when you managed to convene a meeting of the Quartet. To produce movement now, at this period of profound insecurity in the region, and profound insecurity in Israel, was an extremely positive service. I should like to make this very clear. You occasionally have to endure criticism from this House, too. For this reason, some praise is perhaps also in order. As far as the contents are concerned, I should like to make it clear that I do not believe that Israel is sceptically disposed towards democracy in Arab countries. It is merely that these changes have not yet come to an end. When and if there are democracies there, I agree completely with Mr Pöttering and with you too, Mr Swoboda, then there will clearly be a great opportunity finally to get the Middle East peace process going too. Settlement building must stop, that is clear in any case, as must the sophistry with which it is defended. There is a consensus among all groups in this House on that point. Connected to the uprising in the Arab world, we also have experienced protests against the Hamas regime in the Gaza Strip. The situation in the Palestinian Territories is in no way simple. Democratisation must succeed here too. For the time being, we fortunately have a moderate and conservative partner in the West Bank, but that is absolutely not the case in the Gaza Strip.
costep_2001-04-02_3_15	Madam President, I would like to draw both your and Parliament’s attention to two very important decisions that have recently been taken by two European companies, which have stirred up great feeling amongst the working population. As you know, Danone recently decided to close down several European factories, getting rid of thousands of workers, despite this very company telling us not long ago that its previous year’s profits had been fairly significant. In addition, Marks & Spencer recently decided to close down all its European outlets outside Great Britain. This seems to be an illegal decision, in that the unions and the Works Councils were not notified and the workers found out what would their fate would be from the radio. I would like to know, therefore, if it would be possible for you, Madam President, and if it would be possible for Parliament, to make a statement on this unacceptable action, perhaps at the next part-session, which, on the one hand, is discrediting the social Europe that several of you want to see, and, on the other hand, constitutes a denial of justice and an attack on the dignity of the working population.
costep_2010-11-24_9_201	I endorsed the European Parliament motion for a resolution on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), because I think that as part of the fight against piracy it is necessary to establish common principles for the enforcement of intellectual property rights. The problem of the counterfeiting of goods and the unauthorised use of other people’s intellectual property is still widespread. It is particularly difficult in the case of intangible property, such as the copyright to musical and literary works and patents. ACTA will be a good tool for establishing a common legal platform whose objective will be to fight counterfeiting and piracy.
costep_2010-03-09_7_84	The SOLVIT network became operational in July 2002, having been created by the Commission and the Member States with the aim of resolving the problems that were being experienced by members of the public and businesses as a result of the misapplication of internal market legislation, allowing a swift, free and effective response without recourse to the courts. All the EU Member States along with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have created SOLVIT centres at national level, mostly integrated with their respective ministries of economy or foreign affairs. These centres cooperate directly through an electronic database in order to find rapid and pragmatic solutions to the problems submitted by members of the public and businesses. The Member States must intensify their efforts to provide information to members of the public and businesses on the rights that they enjoy within the internal market, thus allowing them to exercise these rights. The services provided by SOLVIT must be made known to members of the public and businesses in an effective way.
costep_2008-03-13_5_17	In general terms it can be said that the purpose of this report is to encourage the integration of the 'new' Member States into EU external policy, particularly 'development cooperation policy' and 'European neighbourhood policy'. The report also considers that the 'new' Member States represent an opportunity for the EU 'to reinforce its strategic presence in eastern Europe, central Asia and the Caucasus', regions with which the 'new' Member States have priority relationships and which have received less EU 'aid' to date. This means seeking to make use of the privileged relationship of the eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 as an EU intervention instrument (taking into account the interests of the major powers and their large economic and financial groups, particularly in the energy sector) in the countries of the Community of Independent States, the Western Balkans and the Caucasus. That is, seeking to make use of those countries' 'experience' of 'transition' to capitalism and to inclusion in NATO and the EU as a model to be followed in these regions. This is ultimately what is at issue: a policy that disguises the interests of capitalism with 'development'.
costep_2009-12-16_9_23	Madam President, I am delighted that the Swedish Presidency has strengthened the European Union’s commitment to stability and development in Afghanistan through the action plan. I would, of course, like to know more about funding for this plan as far as Afghanistan is concerned. Another very important moment for Afghanistan will be the London Conference in January. At that conference, we will hear about the specific pledges made by the European Union and its Member States. We should also hear from the new Afghan Government about the many commitments it must make in areas such as combating corruption and drug trafficking. I am rather alarmed at reports in today’s press of the speech given yesterday by President Karzai on the corruption issue. Ladies and gentlemen, President Obama’s decision to increase his military contingent by 30 000 troops is very recent. In short, Afghanistan is at a crucial stage and the United States and Europe must work in a very coordinated manner. What is at stake in Afghanistan is not only the prosperity and freedom of Afghans, but also the stability of the region, including such an important country as Pakistan. Our own security is also at stake, given the continuing threat posed by al-Qaeda, as has already been said. The credibility of NATO and of what we call the West also depends to a large extent on the results in Afghanistan. We cannot fail. In order to succeed, though, as has also been said, we need the support of our own citizens. This support is conditional on transparency and clarity. We must explain that our compatriots in Afghanistan are in serious danger, but we must also stress the importance of the mission there and that failure cannot be an option. As I have said, many important factors are at stake.
costep_1998-05-12_8_3	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing an important directive on water intended for human consumption: it is important both because it seeks to protect our health from the negative effects of water contamination and pollution, and because it will finally provide the Member States with a more flexible and appropriate framework of regulations than the current one, which goes back a good 18 years. The directive will enable us to have a Community policy on drinking water and, finally, will enable consumers to be better informed. The Member States will have to face investment, which will amount to around 100 000 million euros over the entire Community territory. This is important because control programmes, methods of measuring and analysing the quality of drinking water and widespread control of the entire system of all drinking water supply networks will be implemented. More than 50 million kilometres of old pipes will certainly have to be replaced as well. Unfortunately, however, water contamination causes various problems, despite being the source of life, as Mr Florenz pointed out at first reading. Water is no longer odourless, colourless and tasteless. Measures therefore need to be taken, in compliance with the provisions of the World Health Organization. It seems incredible to me, and I fail to understand why the values of the WHO are taken into consideration for certain elements and not for others. I am referring to copper, which is still included in the table of chemical parameters, which lists arsenic, cyanide, mercury, lead and other poisons. Although the WHO has specified that a level of 2 milligrams of copper per litre of drinking water offers a suitable level of safety; although the European Parliament, you will recall, voted in favour at first reading, including copper in the table of indicative parameters; although the use of pipes with a low copper content could enable considerable savings to be made for the Member States; although there is no alternative system as yet The President cut off the speaker
costep_1999-11-18_16_4	Mr President, allow me to welcome the initiative by Germany to improve the exchange of information on counterfeit documents. This exchange of information is of great importance for the protection and security of people in Europe. Europe needs a legal area in which its citizens feel at home and protected. An essential contribution to this is the cross-border regulations and protection systems that make life difficult for criminals. The German initiative endeavours to achieve such a system. By exchanging information on counterfeit documents the counterfeiting itself is contained. That is an essential contribution to combating smuggling and other crimes and - I think this is very important - all other kinds of crime. So it is quite sensibly in the proposal for a Council Decision. The rapporteur wants to amend paragraph 3 of the preamble and limit the crimes to the offence of illegal immigration. He implies that illegal immigration is the greatest crime that we have to combat. My dear colleague, where do you actually live? Have you never heard anything about drug dealers and the couriers of the money launderers with suitcases full of bank notes? Do I really have to make you a list of travellers' crimes? Amendment 6 is a disgrace! It mocks our citizens who expect protection and security from the European Union. We must vote by a large majority against this amendment. We cannot allow ourselves the intellectual freedom to be afraid of a few poor creatures who sneak in with forged documents and at the same time guarantee serious criminals the freedom to travel. The Legal Committee that has dealt with this matter was also unanimous and, I repeat, unanimous, in this opinion with all the other Groups after an in-depth examination and, as I said just now, I want this measure to apply to all crime. That is the reason why my Group will vote against all these amendments in the vote tomorrow morning.
costep_1997-09-18_7_65	Mr President, this is a topical and urgent debate. An hour ago a bomb exploded in a tourist bus in Cairo: nine people were killed, including six German tourists. I wish to express my sympathy. On my fax machine I have received a cry for help from Guatemala. Felipe de Jesurín and Immelda Lopez de Sandoval were pursued by cars and threatened with death. Mr President, by speaking their names, I can possibly save their lives. We were dealing with Ethiopia. For two years, people have been knocking on my door about the violation of human rights. I believed that the government after the dictatorship should be given space. Unfortunately that did not work. On 11 July I wrote and asked for clarification about the murder of Assefa Maru and Wakotola. The ambassador promised a reply. I telephoned him recently. He was arrogant and my request fell on deaf ears. Mr President, if an ambassador is not even open-minded enough to listen to the real worries about imprisoned journalists and arbitrary executions, then we have at the very least the right to denounce that. This is a sign to Ethiopia and my group supports that sign.
costep_1998-06-18_7_6	Mr President, I would like to speak about the report by Mr McCartin dealing with the vital matter of the future for the market in fishery products in the European Union. Of course, there is no question but that the demand from the European market calls for a substantial share of imports from developing countries. But let us not forget that 80 % of these imports already benefit from a preferential tariff system, many are even duty-free. So the rapporteur is right - and Mrs Fraga pointed this out before I did - when he states that the Commission has a duty to protect Community producers to the best of its ability and that further measures to abolish customs duty on fishery products from outside the EU are really not what we want. First, catches by fishermen of the European Union are governed by a self-evident fact: if there are no resources, there are no more catches. This is why we must obviously support the efforts designed to control supply on the basis of market demand. Also, as the rapporteur pointed out, we must encourage producers' organizations to work to catch plans and it seems logical - for the benefit of the fresh goods market - to steer intervention tools in the direction of withdrawals for put-back, rather than withdrawals for dumping. We must encourage quality policies. Of course, the existing joint organization of markets provides support for producers' organizations that commit themselves to quality improvement plans. Whilst that assistance has not yielded the success we might have expected, this is due neither to its underlying principle nor the lack of forward-planning, but to insufficient amounts. It is vital therefore that we revitalize the appeal of these incentives by stepping up the amounts involved. We must let consumers know about these policies by showing our support, in particular, for those products that can be identified with a specific region, once they have been subjected to rigorous, thoroughly-tested quality control procedures. Nevertheless, I would still question the advisability and actual definition of the eco labels we have in mind. In this respect, the Commission would call upon specialists in the fishing industry and any others involved. What exactly does that mean? Does that imply official recognition of quality labels awarded by bodies set up for that specific purpose and funded, for example, by industrial consortia seeking to implant a positive image in the minds of the consumers? Or, perhaps, by others whose ecological rhetoric often conceals a baser, customer-oriented philosophy? In which case, we might see the Commission turn against any scientific analysis and leap onto the bandwagon of a public opinion largely ignorant of sea-faring matters, easily deflected and, in some cases, easily manipulated - a particularly loathsome example of which we have just witnessed.
costep_2004-01-12_1_71	Mr President, it is a striking coincidence that this afternoon should find us discussing air and maritime safety. Only this afternoon, Mr Pex, together with Mr Doorn and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, three members of the Dutch delegation, boarded a small plane whose brakes failed and which subsequently collided with a hangar, as a result of which he cannot make it here on time. I have been asked for that reason to present his contribution to the House. When I therefore talk about 'me', I am talking on behalf of Mr Pex, who, incidentally, is doing fine. It is of major importance that the discharge of oil at sea should be prevented. Disasters cause significant discharges, which are, with good reason, given a great deal of attention. Illegal discharges, however, from vessels other than tankers, also constitute a major problem, especially because they occur frequently and are rarely traced. In the few cases when discharges are traced, there are very few prosecutions, and hardly any punishment. That is a perplexing situation. The draft directive that is currently under discussion should rectify this situation without delay. There are sufficient rules internationally to address the situation. The problem is, however, that Member States flout the rules to which they have committed themselves in treaties. The solution is to include internationally valid discharge regulations in Community law and make provisions for enforcement rules. Infringements must be given the character of offences in respect of which it must also be possible to prosecute according to criminal law. Further to the disaster involving the, Heads of Government have asked on two occasions, namely on 21 March and 13 December of 2002, strict measures to be introduced before the end of 2003. The Commission submitted a sound proposal on time, which I - Mr Pex - have been able to correct with the help of fellow Members from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, along with the co-advisory committees via a number of amendments. I thank the Commission and the fellow Members for the pleasant collaboration. I would like to make a few observations regarding the proposal. The European rules must apply to all illegal discharges on inland waterways and at sea, both inside and outside of the territorial waters. It is important not only to be critical the shipping crew, but also mainly the ships' owners and the authorities on land. A common European coast guard is desirable in order to trace discharges more effectively and for the authorities to act more quickly and more adequately. For both this coast guard and the already established European Maritime Agency (EMSA), it is important to have sufficient powers to enhance safety at sea. Ten amendments have been tabled in respect of the text of my report that has been approved by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. Of these ten, I am happy to adopt the two technical amendments tabled by Mr Sterckx, because their intention is to clarify the text. As I have already stated, the introduction of criminal sanctions is a good instrument. Unfortunately, the self-same Council that requested them, is now not prepared to accept this proposal, because it is believed that criminal law falls within the remit of the third pillar. Although I as rapporteur have tried to work together with the Council, because the prompt introduction of the measures is conducive to safety at sea, the Council cried off. It appears that in those circles, discussions of principle take precedence over safety at sea. In other words, the Council’s conduct leaves something to be desired. The Heads of Government who have asked for measures on two occasions should take action to make swift introduction still possible. It would be preferable if this were done now rather than when a new disaster occurs, which Heaven forbid. On behalf of Mr Pex, I am able to say: ‘I have spoken’.
costep_2008-04-09_20_34	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again in the last few days, in Saint-Nazaire in France, some workers - this time Greek - employed by a German subcontractor to another subcontractor in the shipbuilding industry, have gone unpaid. European Court of Justice jurisprudence has reaffirmed the employment rights of workers seconded within the EU, but how effective are these rights if Europe is not equipped with the necessary legislation to compensate for the failings of subcontractors? We are no longer talking about isolated cases. Throughout the European Union, order-givers are increasingly using tiers of subcontractors from other Member States, and cases of seconded workers not being paid are becoming more common. Three men, three Greek employees, finally obtained payment of their wages, but only after three weeks of hunger strike. We cannot make grandiloquent speeches about Europe and do nothing. It is essential that, as soon as possible, we come up with the necessary legal arsenal for order-givers to be held responsible for the failings of subcontractors.
costep_2003-03-13_4_84	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Fischler on the communication that he has just given this Parliament, but I cannot. I am unable to do so because of the lopsided thinking that has led to the belated approach to a problem that has been around for a considerable time, as in fact the Commissioner stated a few moments ago, and also because of the disappointing content of this Commission communication. Today, at best, we will be attempting to limit the damage caused by the abuse of Community aid granted to multinational companies. Perhaps, if the Commission had shown greater foresight and been more vigilant, the situations involving the closure and restructuring of companies that have led to this Commission communication would not have occurred. On my own behalf and on behalf of the PPE-DE, I wish to express my total solidarity with all the workers, especially those in Portugal, affected by foreign companies' decisions to close. Job losses deal a devastating blow to the workers affected and their families. I shall highlight two cases with which I am very familiar: those of the Clark shoe factory and the Bawo clothing factory. Last January, the management of the Clark company decided, unexpectedly and without consulting anyone, to close their factory in Castelo de Paiva in Portugal, leaving 588 workers unemployed. Two years previously, acting in a similar way, they had shut down their factory at Arouca in the same region, leaving almost 500 people unemployed. Clark had benefited from enormous sums of Community, national and local aid. Despite this fact, the company claimed that the justification for these mass redundancies was their having to import shoe uppers from India and Romania in order to maintain a competitive price structure. I have just quoted verbatim from the press release issued by Clark on 10 January. The other case is as follows. Last February, the management of the Bawo company proceeded to remove the machinery from its factory at Estarreja under the cover of night and entirely without the knowledge of its workers. By pure chance, one of them realised what was going on and alerted her colleagues. All the workers maintained a vigil at the factory gates, day and night, in the rain and cold, until the courts ordered the seizure of the equipment. Both companies intend to relocate to enlargement countries and to third countries. These cases are models of a poor example to set and raise the following questions: where is the balance between economic interests and those of the companies and the rights of workers and of society? If this situation continues, what will become of the European social model? Mr President, Commissioner, we are in favour of competitiveness, we are not enemies of globalisation, we understand the competitive nature of the world market, but we cannot accept the economy being considered to be an end in itself rather than something at the service of mankind. What we cannot tolerate is that the money from all European taxpayers should be used to reward companies that skip from country to country in the pursuit of greater profit and cheaper labour. Companies act in this way, moreover, without any social concern, either for their workers and their families, and even less for the economic effects on the regions affected. Subsidies that are granted must serve to create employment and not to fund relocations. It is not our intention to prevent companies from closing or relocating their factories, but to ensure that those benefiting from financial aid give commitments and provide guarantees for long-term employment. The European Union’s priority is employment. The Lisbon strategy set the objective of achieving full employment within the decade. This Parliament is increasingly apprehensive about the progress that has been made in the European Union with regard to the Lisbon ambition. This phenomenon of factory relocating is spreading in several Member States, creating unemployment and endangering the economic and social development of the regions. The consequence of this will be greater pressure on social security systems, which will have to bear the costs of social assistance for these unemployed citizens and we are, of course, moving even further away from the vision laid down in Lisbon. Something must be done urgently. We therefore call on the Commission to draw up a legislative framework that will attach a moral component to granting companies Community funds. Clear rules must be established, which prevent and punish abuses by companies that receive subsidies from the European Union. The Commission must refuse to grant aid to companies that fail to respect the commitments they have given to the Member States and must force them to pay such aid back. As an immediate measure, we urge the Commission to monitor closures currently underway and to draw up a list of companies that fail to comply. I wish to use my final words to welcome the support of the other political groups in this Parliament, in particular that of our socialist colleagues, who have understood the reach of the serious consequences of these company relocations in the Community area.
costep_2004-10-25_1_19	Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr Buttiglione, who has recently become the target of a chauvinistic attack by the Left of this House and by all Left-wing extremists. Mr Buttiglione, there are still people who share your sensible views. I would ask you not to lose faith and to be truthful, as the truth cannot be suppressed, particularly in the European Parliament, which by all accounts wishes to be the leading institution in the building of a structure of truth, honesty, reliability and human rights. I would therefore ask whether condemning someone for honestly and publicly expressing beliefs that do not harm anyone does not constitute a violation of human rights. Mr Buttiglione, a great many, and indeed I am sure the majority, of the Members of this House stand shoulder to shoulder with you. Our hearts and souls tell us you will be an outstanding Commissioner.
costep_2000-11-30_2_56	This is a particularly serious report and in adopting it Parliament gives its support to a greater militarisation of the European Union, with a view to establishing a 50 - 60 000 strong Rapid Reaction Force by 2003 to be mobilised within 60 days and deployable for a year with the necessary air and maritime support. It emphasises the development of the European Union’s military assets and capabilities and the Member States' effort to close the gaps that currently exist in this field, as they have just done in the fields of strategic air transport, cruise missiles and reconnaissance and navigation satellites. Equally serious is the intention that any State that does not wish to take part in a mission should be required to pay a financial contribution to be divided up among the States participating in that war. Another point deserving our disapproval is the satisfaction with the framework agreement signed in Farnborough by six countries of the European Union, since this will facilitate the restructuring of the defence industries in Europe and emphasise a space policy covering the civilian and military aspects of the use of space and combining the European Union national and multinational resources the holds in the military field. Lastly, it should be noted that in Nice, as the report states, the definitive CESDP bodies - Military Committee and Military Staff - may be set up with responsibilities and decision-making powers enabling swifter progress to be made towards the implementation of the common security and defence policy. We can therefore only vote against this report.
costep_2010-02-10_10_291	Turkey has done a great deal in its efforts to comply with the Copenhagen criteria. Very significant progress has been made in terms of complying with the standards of a market economy. If, however, we are talking about changes in the areas of politics, democracy or human rights, then although there has been significant progress in creating law, its implementation has not been so successful. This, too, needs to be understood, as it requires a change in social consciousness, which is something that happens slowly. However, European standards in the area of human rights, women’s rights and treatment of prisoners and national and religious minorities must be met. Some opponents of Turkish integration are guided by reasons unconnected with the substance of the matter, and others by fears that Turkey is a big country which will have a big influence on EU decisions, because, in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, the voting power of each Member State is dependent on the size of its population. Turkey’s membership will certainly be a huge burden to the EU budget, but it should be borne in mind that it is a big market which is important for the Union. Turkey is a significant member of NATO and is an important partner of the USA and many EU Member States. It is also a territory which could provide routes for the transfer of energy sources to Europe. Finally, let us remember that Turkey could become a bridge for inter-religious dialogue as well as cultural and even macro-regional dialogue. The presence of Turkey in the Union could help stabilise this large and important region of the world. Turkey must understand that it cannot change its past. Mistakes have to be admitted. Then it is easier to live and establish good relations with one’s neighbours.
costep_2009-03-24_5_127	I support the Sârbu report and the Commission proposal, which make a technical amendment to the existing legislation. The current directive provides for a transitional period (2000-2010), during which the biocides market will continue to be regulated by national rules. However, it also provides for a 10-year programme for the evaluation of active substances used in biocides, aimed at including them on a positive list to be set up by the Commission. As the current state of progress in the review programme of this directive will not allow it to be completed by 2010 as planned, it has become necessary to make the appropriate amendments so that the transitional periods for the most delayed cases can be extended. That is why this proposal for amendment is appropriate.
costep_2001-02-12_6_9	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is a fine example of how this Parliament manages, on an issue as important as the interoperability of the Union’s railways, to take decisions quickly and to avoid a Conciliation Committee and a third reading. I therefore wish to congratulate Mr Savary on his openness to dialogue, on his competence and on his demonstration of how crucial the action of the European Parliament is to improving standards as important as those with a social aspect, improving the position of rail users and eastwards enlargement. This is a warning to anyone who wishes to reduce our Parliament’s ability to act for the sake of more rapid decision making. This directive, which supplements those that we adopted in the last Brussels mini-session will, I hope, enable Europe to move beyond good intentions and give rail transport a greater role than it currently enjoys. For a country such as Portugal, located at the south-western edge of Europe, the interoperability of rail transport is crucial. Any country situated at the end or at the beginning of a railway line is always dependent on other countries if it is to enjoy a high level of cross-border traffic. Connecting ports to railway lines that are interoperational is a decisive step towards improving the service that is provided, towards reducing transport costs and towards making European rail companies profitable.
costep_2011-05-11_6_474	The current report evaluates the development of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) in the wake of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. It is a report based on the new institutional framework created by the Treaty of Lisbon, according to which the European Union must speak with a single voice and, based on its restructuring, present common foreign and security policy in a more transparent way. However, it is necessary to recognise that the EU has still not achieved a comprehensive post-Lisbon approach, able to overcome traditional procedural and institutional obstacles. As such, a realistic foreign policy assessment becomes crucial, including more muscular intervention by EU forces, rather than leaving military intervention solely in the hands of France and the United Kingdom. Whilst I recognise the need for public debate on foreign and defence policy towards setting out Parliament’s future policies on this matter, I welcome the drafting of this report and hope that the EU continues to develop an effective multilateralism, which is one of the hallmarks of its geostrategic concerns.
costep_2006-06-01_1_112	Whilst the most recent developments in Israel have been welcome, not least the results achieved by a party that is clearly seeking dialogue and agreement, the same cannot be said of the election results in the Palestinian Authority, where the outcome, although regular from the point of view of electoral legality, is doubly worrying. First and foremost, a political group that does not acknowledge Israel’s right to exist, and as such fails to meet one of the prerequisites for the peace process, was able to gain power. It also showed that, in the election, the people under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority did not prioritise a negotiated settlement to this age-old conflict. Against this backdrop, the EU and all of the Quartet must agree on the next steps. We need to be firm with the PA government, but open to President Mahmood Abbas and his initiatives in search of a general agreement on the only acceptable solution, which is the peaceful coexistence of two States. In view of the importance of the role of EU donor, let us hope that on this external front, 'Europe’ proves itself equal to the task of exerting a positive influence on the situation.
costep_1998-01-29_3_5	Madam President, the first thing I want to say is that we think this initiative report by Mr Izquierdo Collado is very timely, but, at the moment, it is just a technological evaluation of the feasibility of these trans-European hydrological networks. In this Parliament, and in the European Union, we are working on the Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Development, which places great importance on the question of water. And that importance, ladies and gentlemen, is due to the fact that most of us in this House are convinced - some are not, but they will soon see - that water is far more important than oil, gas or any other form of energy, because without water there is no life. However, anything that comes out of this study must definitely be included in the water management policy which, as Mr Izquierdo Collado said, is in its infancy in the European Union. Whoever does this study will of course firstly have to take into account an analysis of the alternatives. The first alternative is to use water better. We can save a lot of water if we use it better. Secondly, we have to consider other sources, such as the desalination of sea-water, for example. That is essential for the European Union, in order to produce technological equipment which could be exported to other countries, given that the big problem of the 21st century will be water. It is possible there may be wars over water, ladies and gentlemen. So we are talking about an enormously important technological question. Thirdly, there will need to be an assessment of the energy balance-sheet. It seems to me that this is the big difficulty which these hydrological networks will encounter. If they use up too much energy or if the results are energetically unacceptable, these networks will not be much use. In any case, however, there are many hydrological basins which have already been connected, with transfers being made from one to another. But it is only natural that we should first make these connections and perform these transfers within our own countries. Madam President, Spain, where both Mr Izquierdo Collado and I come from, has a great deal of water, but it is not very well distributed, either in time or in geographical location. It is all up in the north, around Cantabria, with very little in the south. Therefore, we will study these actions in the centre of our country very carefully and, if appropriate, and if the Union makes that decision, we would join in with a water policy based on hydrological networks. Obviously, the economic aspects will need to be studied. Water is badly treated and not given the consideration it deserves: it does not receive sufficient financial resources, especially at municipal level. I think whoever does the technological evaluation work will have to bear that in mind. Obviously, there has to be an environmental impact assessment - European legislation demands that - but there would also have to be a strategic assessment of the plans themselves. I want to inform the rapporteur that the Group of the European People’s Party will support his report, although some of our members have certain doubts, perhaps because they see this important question in a different light. However, I congratulate him in any case.
costep_2003-09-03_3_244	Mr President, up to now we have placed particular emphasis on the fight against communicable diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. We have repeatedly asked for the scope of this action to be extended to other diseases particularly associated with poverty and with poor hygiene and environmental conditions. I therefore very warmly welcome John Bowis’s report, which approaches health in the broadest possible way and takes account of the impact on health of food, environmental and educational policy. Preventing diseases involves improving the living conditions of people in the South, by means of a coherent and integrated development strategy. In the long term a preventive strategy is essential. In the shorter term, we need to ensure that the sick have access to treatment and medicines, which also have to be made available in the first place. It is true that in the majority of countries in the South health systems are poor, but privatising the sector will not solve the problem. Only the public sector can provide free and universal health care. For that reason, health should continue to be excluded from GATS, and I am delighted that this report reiterates that fundamental principle. I of course support the amendment calling for the provisions of the Doha Declaration on medicines to be implemented, especially as the agreement that the TRIPS Council has just reached is supposed to allow it to come into force. Although we welcome this entry into force, it also has to be recognised that the complexity of this agreement means that we have some doubts about its effectiveness. For example, countries without any production capacity will be subject to a double system of mandatory licences and restrictions that they could often find costly. If health really is one of the priorities of the European Union’s development policy, then the Member States should make a firm commitment to grant the mandatory licences developing countries need if they are to protect their public health. We Members of the European Parliament need to join together to exert continuing pressure if this communication is not to be just a dead letter.
costep_2001-09-19_12_9	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs for their tenacity and commitment. I have no doubt that these were essential qualities during the negotiations with the Council, especially in the discussions about large combustion plants. This House was determined to ensure that old plants were included in this directive as well, and finally achieved this goal. This is a key area in which we have been successful. However, we have not been entirely successful. We have had to accept a great many derogations, extensions and lower limit values, not because no other option was technically feasible - for otherwise we would frequently have been accused of trying to achieve the impossible. In this instance, it is quite obvious that upgrading existing plants to meet the standards in modern installations presents no problems from a technical point of view. Indeed, in many sectors, this is already a reality. No, the resistance focussed solely on microeconomic factors relating to specific large combustion plants. This is a short-sighted view. We must think macroeconomically and take account of the public health costs of pollution and harmful emissions. In this respect, I simply cannot understand the Council’s negotiating position on this issue. However, as the directive now includes old plants, I shall vote for the compromise as well.
costep_1998-01-14_4_29	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, further to the comments already made by colleagues in my group, I should like to draw the attention of the presidency to some of the written resolutions of this Parliament in December, which are of great significance both to the Commission as well as the Council. In its resolution on the second reading of the budget the Parliament also formulated various criteria which are significant to the working programme of the presidency, and I should like to ask you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, whether you are prepared to comment on these today or to deal with them when the presidency participates in the individual committees. On the basis of the successful budgetary procedure for 1998 we said that we anticipate an informal collaboration with the Council at the beginning of the year in order to put in motion the setting of realistic common budgetary objectives. Secondly, we said that in view of the successful procedure for agricultural expenditure we anticipate that this procedure will be institutionalized and that we should have a discussion on this in March 1998 at the latest. I should also like to say that in the resolution on the working programme of the Commission we urged that on the question of the legal basis we must finally come to an agreement between the institutions, and I think that the British Presidency of the Council should also devote itself to this tiresome subject. I want to add that along the lines of what was discussed in Luxembourg and what has always been the view of this Parliament, preparations for the reform of the system of capital resources must also be made because this is a very lengthy process which cannot be dealt with within six months. In view of what we learnt in the BSE Investigatory Committee, for me there is also really something missing from what must already have been discussed in the general Council under the Luxembourg Presidency. It is good when you say that we want to have public debates in the Council in the interests of openness and transparency, but in the interests of positive and improved cooperation between all the institutions, and irrespective of the legal interpretation of Article 3 of the inter-institutional agreement on the right of the Investigatory Committee, I also expect the Council to formulate a declaration whereby in the future it is made clear that, irrespective of the legal interpretation of this agreement, national ministers will also say that in the interests of transparency and responsibility we will accept invitations of investigatory committees of the European Parliament. I would be very pleased if you would provide a positive answer to this in your capacity as President-in-Office of the Council as well. Two brief comments on agricultural policy. Clearly, here you have also presented the traditional, historically determined agricultural philosophies of the United Kingdom. I am very anxious to know whether during the course of your presidency of the Council you will - also in terms of the basic philosophy - manage to set in motion the necessary adjustment to the regulation of the banana market and harmonize this with the concepts your presidency of the Council has of agricultural policy. This will be a very exciting debate and I would add that we must be very much on the alert in this respect. Improvements are necessary with regard to the Agenda 2000, which the Parliament is also discussing: liberalization on the one hand, increased levies for European agriculture and at the same time a reduction of expenditure, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. This is in fact a crash course which no one can withstand. What we must agree on is a necessary reform, an adjustment, to achieve a smooth passage enabling the implementation of a model European agricultural policy and at the same time the realization of a consumer protection clause within the framework of the WTO.
costep_2007-10-11_4_13	Mr President, the aviation sector has been in the spotlight in the last few months. The proposals to include the sector in the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme, the agreement with the United States and the reform of landing rights are a few examples. Mrs Jensen’s report adds a new dimension to that list: the organisation of aviation on the ground. It addresses the services being provided, but also noise and available capacity. As far as ground handling services are concerned, we will indeed have to wait for a new evaluation by the Commission in which all Member States are included. I concur with the suggestions to the Commission for points which need looking at in the future. I am a bit more critical about the sections dealing with capacity. The text urges the Commission to take major action. The master plan is intended to be the key to tackling the aviation capacity problem on the ground. A master plan does indeed offer a good overview of the current situation and can indicate problem areas. However, it does not seem to me desirable that the Commission, with such a plan in hand, should force the Member States to take certain steps or indeed stand in their way. The main purpose of a master plan is to promote international cooperation between all parties concerned, so that integrated solutions can be found for specific problem areas through good consultations and with respect for existing authorities. I am pleased that some sections contain sensible comments on this. My conclusion, Mr President, is therefore that I am able to support Mrs Jensen’s report. I very much enjoyed working with her.
costep_1998-10-20_7_11	Mr President, I was very pleased to see how much importance the rapporteur attaches in her text to continuing the procedure we used last year in setting the farm budget. I think this is most important, because the agriculture budget has to be based on the best forecasts available. Secondly, this increases the influence which Parliament is able to exert, and that is good for democracy. It is premature at this stage to say that the farm budget should remain at the same level or maybe even be cut. What counts most for me is that the Commission and thus the European Union should stick to what has been agreed. If it is true that expenditure turns out to be higher than expected, then that is unfortunate, but if it is lower, then automatically that is regarded as a welcome bonus. We have to proceed on a basis of budgeting as realistically as possible, and at the same time we must discharge the obligations we have entered into. There is one thing I have to say about the farm budget. Last year, we expressly asked the Commission to clarify an important budget line, namely accompanying measures. These are particularly important in that there will be more and more talk in future of cross-compliance with regard to income subsidies. We asked the Commission for a report on those measures. It came at the very last moment, just ahead of the second reading. But it was a report made up solely of statistics - somewhat on the lean side. Surely it was not beyond the Commission to produce an analysis of which environmentally friendly farming methods had been the most successful in the Member States? How is it that only five of the 15 Member States draw on the budget lines for accompanying measures, when everyone talks about a better environment and so on? These, I think, are the essential things we need to know as we prepare for the forthcoming round of Agenda 2000 and all the rest. So I would welcome an assurance from the Commission that it will supply us with comprehensive information on the budget line for accompanying measures.
costep_1999-02-10_15_16	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I come from an ultraperipheral banana-producing region of the European Union, I wish to protest in the strongest terms and indicate my deep anger at the retaliatory stance taken by the United States of America in the latest dispute over the Community banana import regime. I must take this opportunity to point out that the European banana-producing regions include some of the ultraperipheral island regions which are still suffering from a lack of economic development. In these regions, banana production is the main and sometimes only source of income for thousands of families. We cannot begin to imagine the economic, social and environmental damage which would have occurred in the autonomous region of Madeira if the European institutions had yielded to the pressures which American-controlled multinationals determined to defend their own interests are continuing to exert on the banana market. Under these circumstances it is clear that, in order to protect itself, the European Union must not submit in any way to the pressure exerted by the USA with regard to matters which may still be under discussion. The European institutions should, within the various international bodies, maintain their steadfast opposition to unilateral retaliatory trade measures. In this respect, the sanctions announced by the USA are scandalous and are already starting to have negative effects on other sectors which have nothing to do with the infamous banana dispute. We totally support the Commission’s position as long as this remains resolutely in accordance with the spirit of the principles and rules of the World Trade Organisation. However, the Commission must be prepared, as it seems to be, to respond rigorously and rapidly if unilateral measures are applied by the United States.
costep_2010-03-24_21_12	The developing countries have ended up the main victims of the financial crisis, in spite of the initial predictions which maintained that the developed countries would be hit hardest. The theory suggesting that developing countries are not tied in strongly enough to the global economy to be seriously affected by the crisis on the financial markets has been disproved by reality. We are seeing the crisis deepening in many developing countries, with unprecedented unemployment rates and exponential growth in government debt and budget deficits. While all this is going on, developed countries which have not felt the impact of the crisis very strongly or have had available effective instruments for mitigating its impact have experienced economic growth, albeit tentative. The economic crisis is already affecting the population directly, while unemployment is on the rise in developing countries. The efforts being made to bring about economic recovery by the states which continue to feel the effects of the crisis could affect whole social groups, as the recovery measures can only have a painful impact. EU funding programmes are the most comprehensive and inclusive among the financial aid schemes available globally. The Member States affected must benefit as appropriately as possible from the money allocated for tackling situations which restrict economic activity and have social ramifications.
costep_1999-12-15_3_13	Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, you have made a very positive appraisal of the Bonn Conference which, from your point of view, I can understand. In all honesty, however, although there has been progress in secondary theatres of war, as it were, for example how negotiations should be conducted, what working parties should be set up, no progress has been made on the main issue, i.e. what should be done about emission rights and emissions trading. That is a pity because, as far as I can see, that is the main issue, especially in view of the fact that one large country, one contracting partner, is saying we want to be able to buy ourselves out of all our emissions obligations. That this country is able to use internal political debate, i.e. the imminent election campaign in the USA, to block us and the other contracting States from making further progress on this central issue is scandalous! As far as I can see, the decisive question is this: how can we inject new momentum into this process and encourage greater involvement on the part of this large contracting State on the other side of the Atlantic? How can we achieve progress in coming years and involve the United States in this? As far as I am concerned, there can be no question of allowing countries to buy their way out of all their emission obligations, because what that means, in essence, is that we and the USA are able to absolve ourselves from our own obligations at the expense of less developed countries. We overcame imperialism in the 19th century; surely we are not going to pave the way for imperialism in the 21st century!
costep_2002-06-13_4_166	Mr President, I am dismayed by the way in which the human rights situation has developed in Malaysia, particularly since the events of 11 September. Under the pretext of combating terrorism, Malaysia’s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has made much use of the Internal Security Act, which authorises the detention without trial of anyone suspected of undermining national security, to muzzle all political opposition and to intensify the repressive measures contravening individual freedoms, notably freedom of expression. In a few months, we have moved from the image of a country on the up and up, run by civilised people, to that of a country whose leaders are destroying with their own hands what they have built up. That is why Parliament is duty-bound to condemn these abuses and call upon the Malaysian Government not only to guarantee respect for individual freedoms but also to abolish that notorious Internal Security Act and to ratify without delay the International Convention on Human Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention Against Torture. It is also vital that the European Parliament send a mission to Malaysia in order to investigate the conditions under which the political prisoners are being detained and the violations of their basic rights. Finally, the European Union should place this issue on the agendas of the forthcoming meetings between the European Union and the ANASE.
costep_1999-11-16_7_3	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, creating a uniform judicial area is one of the European Union’s fundamental tasks. It must afford the citizens protection and safety, indeed security on which they can rely. Otherwise the people will not feel at home in a Europe moving towards further integration and they will reject it. The uniform European judicial area must therefore be more than judicial cooperation between the Member States on the basis of international treaties. It must be coherent, guarantee an equally high level of protection everywhere and, above all, rule out any form of discrimination, even if it is only procedural in nature. The Treaty of Amsterdam has enabled us to take a sizeable step forwards. In principle, it has communitarised"" judicial cooperation in civil matters. Instead of turning to international treaties in this field, the Member States must now reach for the European legal instruments, i.e. regulations and directives, which come into being with the participation of the European Parliament as the elected forum representing the people. We now have before us, in this draft regulation on family law, an important component of the European judicial area. When we have finished with it, it will be possible to make it available for inspection, for the Commission has produced a good proposal. It is no contradiction that I, as rapporteur, should, nevertheless, consider it necessary for a series of amendments to be made which the Committee on Citizens Freedoms and Rights, - please spare me having to use the correct name, which is unpronounceable - has unanimously approved. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to digress and touch on the matters of everyday life with which our legislation concerns itself. Breaking down borders between the Member States has not only created an internal market in Europe that is enabling the economy to flourish, it has also afforded the citizens of Europe a hitherto unknown degree of freedom. An ever increasing number of people are taking advantage of this new-found mobility. They get to know each other, find they like each other and pair off. Love has its own rules and develops at a pace that legislation has trouble keeping up with. This becomes clear only when there is a splitting up of partnerships that spanned the boundaries created by nationality and systems of laws. For it is then that former partners and different systems of laws quickly come to oppose each other as adversaries with all the unpleasant consequences this entails, children often being the ones to suffer most. You will all be familiar with the kind of headlines we see when conflicts of this kind escalate to a point where people abduct their own children. Laws cannot stop people falling out and suffering the consequences. What laws can do though is to help keep this suffering within certain boundaries and ensure that there is no additional suffering owing to the application of differing, incoherent laws. The vagaries of the process alone can bring people to the point of despair, for example when it comes to the place of jurisdiction or the recognition of judgements. The Regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility for joint children represents an attempt within the scope of the law to help alleviate and avoid the suffering engendered by broken partnerships. It was my responsibility, as a rapporteur within the European Parliament, to ensure that the required regulation attains its goals without it becoming as incomprehensible to the citizens of Europe as its title. This is the light in which we are to view those amendments which, as has already been mentioned, were unanimously approved in committee following intensive discussions. There was only one point on which opinion differed at the end of the vote in committee, that of giving a child the opportunity to be heard in custody proceedings. I personally consider it imperative for a child to be heard if we are to do all we can to secure his or her welfare. An alternative view is that this goal can be achieved by different methods. Working together with Mr Watson, I have now arrived at a solution that takes account of both views. I would expressly like to extend my thanks to Mr Watson for this, for he too is particularly concerned with the welfare of children, who are often the ones to suffer most when couples separate. I intend to table the compromise we have reached as an oral amendment at the vote, and it is my hope that this distinguished Chamber will lend its support to this process tomorrow. It goes without saying that we should also adopt the amendment then. There is also another way in which we could lend added value to the regulation, although it is a point on which the European Parliament does not have the power to decide, only to request. As you are already aware, three Member States are not, in principle, party to the legally relevant acts of Title IV, in accordance with the Additional Protocols to the Treaty of Amsterdam, and are therefore not bound by them. However, two of these States are prepared to adopt the regulation we are discussing today. I urge the remaining State to accept the regulation as well. For if it were to do so then we would have taken a considerable step forward in terms of standardisation of family law within the European Union. On a final note, permit me to emphasise three points, in respect of which it was important to me, following numerous discussions with those affected and with lawyers, to improve the Commission’s sound proposal. Firstly, when conflicts occur, the welfare of the children must be paramount and all other interests must take second place. Secondly, there must be no discrimination where disputes are concerned. The law must afford everyone, wherever they happen to be in the European Union, a comparably high level of individual protection. Thirdly, the jurisdiction of courts must be unambiguous and easily understandable. There must be no possibility of the recognition and enforcement of judgements being used as weapons of revenge. I believe I have the support of the Commission and I would like to thank all those who, by virtue of their constructive cooperation, made things easier for me with this report outside the parliamentary routine. In addition, I would like, just this once, here in this Chamber, to sing the praises of the Council, which likewise put all its weight behind this issue and made known its view that we need to reach a sound decision here with all due haste.
costep_2001-06-11_7_2	Mr President, we are dealing with one of the few, but nevertheless serious, problems resulting from the removal of our internal borders. From the very beginnings of the single market, it was established that the free movement of goods had to be compatible with the protection of the artistic and cultural heritage of each of the Member States. It was, and continues to be, within the competence of each State to define its national heritage and its protection. Since 1 January 1993, however, measures became necessary, such as the harmonisation of requirements for sales and the uniformity of the control procedure for extra-community exportation. To this end, in 1992 and 1993, the Regulation and the directive which we are discussing today were adopted. The philosophy of the Regulation can be summed up as follows: each Member State is obliged to control the exportation not only of its own heritage, but also of any heritage which is located within its territory, but which originates in one of the other fourteen Member States. Nine years later, except for a few minor amendments, the text and the approach of 1992 are still in force. It must also be pointed out that the problem of the illegal trafficking in cultural goods and its impunity are more serious than ever. The forecasts are even more pessimistic if we bear in mind that, when the rich heritage of the candidate countries is incorporated into the single market, the current legislation may still be in force despite being shown to be insufficient. In 1993, the Commission committed itself to monitoring the progress and the degree of effectiveness of the two regulations in force every three years, as well as proposing corrections where necessary. It tried to do so in 1996, but, when it requested information from the Member States, it received no response from the majority of them. In some cases, the delays in incorporating the Regulation into the legislation of each Member State were scandalous; in four cases the Regulation did not enter into force until 1998. Finally, in 1998 the Commission obtained certain data, opinions and experiences and, on that basis, has produced the report which we are discussing today. It is a purely informative communication, that is, it does not contain any proposals for new measures or amendments of the current ones. It is a voluntary report, which lacks sufficient data to make objective measurements and also, in my opinion, lacks the criteria necessary to propose any improvement to the current procedure. We can, however, draw certain conclusions. Some of these conclusions, though fewer in number, are positive, such as the fact that the very existence of the two regulations has been sufficient to increase the awareness of administrations and public opinion and to bring about extrajudicial solutions. There are, however, a larger number of negative conclusions which can be summed up in one: the general practice is still that a Member State authorising the export of a cultural item does not check with its State of origin whether the item’s provenance is legal or illegal. In the majority of cases, the administrations of the Member States have not properly cooperated with each other, in particular the police and customs departments, that is to say, the units that are part of the Interior Ministries. It is here that I would like to point out one of the cruxes of the problem; on the one hand, these units of the administration have other border priorities relating to organised crime. On the other hand, this cooperation falls under the third pillar, which is so difficult to achieve, as you well know. Therefore, the situation is serious in two respects; the increase in the intra-community clandestine trade in historical and cultural goods, and also the increase in their exportation beyond our external borders. The explosion in the activities of organised networks, the unrestricted proliferation of antique dealers without sufficient professional standing or control and the practically universal impunity of the people responsible, either because the crime has been only recently defined, just a year ago, or because the mere allegation that a buyer has acted in good faith is sufficient cause for a case not to continue, are some of the reasons for this serious situation. For all these reasons, our report expresses the view that it is crucial that legislation is improved and that a qualitative change is made to the Community’s approach. We believe that this is a cultural issue, which the Council must deal with through the bodies responsible for culture in each Member State. These are crimes or failings which must be detected by Community operational units specialised in artistic and historical heritage; the Commissioner for Culture, rather than any of her colleagues, must make a diagnosis and propose a way of dealing with the situation. All of this should go hand in hand with the integration of the various teams of the departments responsible for trade, the police and customs, but, I repeat, this must be done from a predominantly cultural point of view. Our report also identifies certain difficulties, such as the existence of an unknown heritage in the possession of institutions such as the church. We propose certain specific measures considered to be very urgent - such as the use of the Internet to publish pictures and details of stolen objects - and we request that the Commission, under the direction of the Commissioner for Culture, produce a Green Paper describing the current situation, assess the effects of the Regulation and the directive, carry out a comparative study of the definition of heritage in each Member State and, above all, propose specific measures to improve the situation. The Commissioner for Culture, whom I have admired for years, has for some time adopted a lively and decisive approach to future tasks while remaining cautious and indecisive about the present ones. She has sufficient capacity and resources for this not to be the case. Through this report, Parliament seeks to express its anguish and alarm about the current situation which, despite being the result of the removal of internal borders, which is so beneficial in all other respects, is not being sufficiently addressed by the Community authorities.
costep_2009-10-08_5_29	Madam President, I will try to be brief. Italy is truly a champion of liberty, indeed of libertinage - so to speak - as one can infer from reading its newspapers, which Mr Berlusconi wants to gag, which he is suing because they reveal, among other things, his personal relationships, through which channel he also chooses political candidates. His women who visit him are paid either with money or with promises that they will stand for office. The situation is this: Mr Berlusconi controls the Italian media. It is true, there are no laws against freedom of the press - as yet. Mr Berlusconi is preparing to introduce them. Only recently, we abolished the Alfano law, which was invented by Mr Berlusconi to protect himself from the courts and from all the proceedings currently under way. This is the situation in which we therefore find ourselves. Is it right to ask Europe to deal with this problem? Definitely, because we in Italy are not dealing with it. We are asking Europe to intervene on humanitarian grounds to solve the problem of freedom of the press in Italy. This is what we want you to do, and we believe that it is important for Europe also, if we do not want the virus to spread all too quickly here as well.
costep_2000-06-14_0_5	Mr President, I would like to bring up another point. Not only yesterday, but also a few months ago, every month really, permits are granted to the presidency or other nationalities to organise receptions. These then degenerate into all-out bingeing sessions, at which point the cameras start to roll. I think, Mr President, that that is unworthy of Parliament. What I would like to ask through you is that these kinds of festivity be regulated properly. I think that we can no longer afford this kind of behaviour. I am surprised that permission is granted for this kind of thing, because my request to set up an exhibition for the handicapped, organised by myself, was turned down last week by the same College of Quaestors. My request was looked upon critically, whereas these kinds of party, where we are portrayed as vultures, are simply tolerated. I would ask you to raise this matter with the College of Quaestors in order to put a stop to this, as this is beneath us all.
costep_2011-02-03_9_295	Despite the progress made, the incidence of tuberculosis at global level is still a major cause for concern, as this disease remains one of the main causes of death in the world, especially in developing countries. Research and funding in this area should therefore be increased. It is important to mobilise resources for the Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, as only a large-scale vaccination campaign can contribute to halting the increase in the incidence of tuberculosis by 2015, reversing the trend and eliminating this disease by 2050, as provided for in the United Nations Milliennium Development Goals and in the World Health Organisation’s Stop Tuberculosis programme.
costep_1997-04-08_10_75	I welcome the Commissioner’s announcement that a new proposal is to be put forward this month making the granting of Community aid conditional upon compliance with the existing directives. Then, of course, there are the rest periods, journey times and so on. What I would like to know is how the Commission intends to monitor whether a transporter is obeying the directives? This has always been our biggest problem: we have no system for checking compliance. Will the Commission employ extra inspectors to check whether transporters are obeying the rules? If they are not, they should not be given any further aid.
costep_2011-05-11_4_17	Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we are still a long way from a common foreign policy which is really worthy of the name. You are being criticised for this, but it sometimes seems to me that you have been made the scapegoat in a situation which is outside your control and which is caused by the fact that the Member States do not have the political will to agree on a common approach. Let us take the example of Libya. First of all, Italy blocked the imposition of sanctions, then France recognised the transitional council in Benghazi without any consultation and, finally, Germany abstained during the vote on the resolution in the UN Security Council. There is nothing you can do to change this, but it gives Europe a negative image. In Syria, we should have imposed stronger sanctions, but here, we also needed unanimity. There are some Member States - Greece, Italy and Spain have been mentioned in the press and Germany may also be one of them - which are opposed to this. In this case, you must stand up here and say: 'We have only been able to put 13 on the list'. The need for unanimity is paralysing us. It no longer works with 27 Member States. We must make the next quantum leap forward in our common foreign and security policy. I would like to make this quite clear to Mr Tannock and his Tory friends. What can you do? Make public the fact that European cooperation has failed and identify who is responsible. Make use of the community instruments, in particular, to promote democracy. I was surprised to hear you speaking here so openly about the European Endowment for Democracy. We are in the process of drawing up a report on the subject with Mrs De Keyser as the rapporteur and we are evaluating what the requirements are. I must make it quite clear that we do not want a second European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which is bureaucratic, slow, over-complex and unpolitical. We need a solution that is unbureaucratic, fast, simple and political. If you can bring this about, you will have our full support.
costep_2002-03-12_2_66	Mr President, underlying this report is the decision to liberalise the internal energy market through the privatisation of the public electricity and gas sectors that still exist in the European Union. Failing to heed negative experiences of similar processes, as in the case of California, for example, the report insists on the need to open up and liberalise these strategic sectors, and to make them more competitive in order to satisfy the interests of various economic groups, even with the knowledge that they are thereby endangering fundamental aspects of a universal public service: the right to the supply of high-quality energy at a reasonable price and the commitment to develop alternative and renewable forms of energy. Although these reports express some concern about universal access, minimum environmental rules, information and guaranteeing consumer choice and security of supply in every country, the fact is that taking the route towards the liberalisation and total opening up of the market will undermine these concerns. Consequently, we have, of course, voted against the report.
costep_2011-01-17_13_13	Madam President, over the many years it has been in operation, the European Union has created an enormously complex structure of various rules and regulations, which ought to give the public the impression that the Union cares about the purity and quality of our food. In order to reinforce this message, it has employed many different specialists, inspectors, vets and officials, developing a complex institutional behemoth to guarantee European food quality. Ladies and gentlemen, today we see how well it is doing. Europe is awash with badly contaminated foods, and our bureaucratic apparatus clearly does not know what to do about it. In order to understand the seriousness of the situation, let us recall what this wheeler-dealing with food has served up for us. The scientific community considers dioxins to be the most poisonous chemical that man has ever produced. They are carcinogens of the most serious category, but they also cause reductions in cell and hormonal immunity, greater susceptibility to infection, reduced fertility, increased abortions, dysfunctional ovaries, childbirth problems, greater infant mortality, problems with the development of the central nervous system, pathological changes to steroid hormones and receptors, and so on. They do not break down. They accumulate in the tissues of living organisms, and the World Health Organisation states that if a quantity of dioxin amounting to one grain of rice gets into circulation, it is equivalent to the annual limit for one million people. We are also finding out today that the German company Harles and Jentzsch has been adding dioxins to animal fodder, and has supplied up to 3 000 tonnes of dioxin-contaminated fat to the market since March 2010. According to current findings, contaminated eggs have made their way to the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and contaminated meat to France and Denmark. I would therefore like to ask, Commissioner, how is it possible that a company supplying feed mixes to thousands of farmers is not registered in a regulated control system? What sort of cooperation can we be getting from state institutions in Germany when a company can produce feed mixes without, at the same time, being registered in a system of control? What sort of veterinary controls can there be at farms, when veterinary inspectors have failed to identify the contamination of the fodder since March 2010? Ladies and gentlemen, what is happening about the disposal of these foods? We talk about the disposed eggs and the disposed meat and what The President cut off the speaker
costep_2007-12-12_5_11	I am taking the floor pursuant to that provision of the rules which gives me the right to personal explanation because Mr. Cohn-Bendit insulted people in this hall. These are personal insults for which, Mr. Cohn-Bendit, you have no right to hide behind your parliamentary immunity. Say that you relinquish your immunity and then insult Members of Parliament! As to what happened here, it is only the freedom of expression which every Member of this Parliament has. I would like to address Mr. Daul. Mr. Daul, if you want Members of Parliament to be forcibly taken out of this hall, aren't you like Hitler who did exactly the same in the German Reichstag? The greatest democracy is direct democracy. And we raised our voice, we exercised out right to free expression, to direct democracy rather than circumvent the European nations as you did. What is going on here is the dictatorship of the new proletariat taking shape in the new Union. Which, this time, is not Soviet but European.
costep_2007-09-24_15_13	Mr. President, as known, on 25 November 2007, elections to the European Parliament will take place in Romania, the first ones of this type in our country’s history. An event of such a political, social and, as I said, historical importance, should mobilize the entire society so that the event could take place under the best conditions. Unfortunately, this is not happening since the political scene in Romania is agitated by endless disputes, a situation that, in my opinion, does not favour the climate of stability required for the normal development of elections. Moreover, if the no-confidence motion submitted today, two months before the elections, is adopted, and it has every chances of being adopted, taking into account that it is initiated by the most numerous opposition party, the political situation may become even worse, the main effect being the decrease in the population’s interest in the elections to the European Parliament. In this situation, I consider it opportune, and maybe even necessary, for the political forces in the European Parliament to join the Romanian ones in order to normalize the conditions for carrying out the elections.
costep_2011-03-24_7_173	For various reasons, the Persian Gulf region is of strategic importance for the European Union, particularly in terms of energy supply. The European Union wants to enter into closer cooperation with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) - an organisation made up of the six richest nations in the region - with the conclusion of a free trade agreement forming a key component of that process. I voted in favour of this report, which prepares the ground for future cooperation between the Union and the GCC. Covering all of the issues relevant to such a partnership, such as the rights of minorities, women’s rights, freedom of conscience and expression, but also support for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and areas for strategic partnership such as research, education and fossil and renewable fuels, the motion proposed by my colleague, Mr Baudis, has achieved a fairly broad consensus among the political groups. However, recent events in Bahrain have given rise to concerns as to whether the report is sufficiently up-to-date. Goodwill on all sides has resulted in some excellent compromise oral amendments being negotiated, thereby bringing the report up to date and ensuring that months of hard work have not been in vain.
costep_2007-02-14_9_6	The fight against terrorism is a priority that requires solidarity from all of the Member States and commitment from the democratic countries. Security is a genuine fundamental right that cannot be exercised at any expense, but in strict accordance with the law and respect for human rights. International terrorism threatens human rights and freedoms. The sinister distinction between murdering terrorists and political terrorists, between armed wings and political wings, only makes the whole thing even more criminal to the detriment of the law. To hold dialogue of any kind with terrorists is unfair, pointless and offensive to the victims. The Member States must pay particular attention to promoting intercultural relations and enhancing inter-religious dialogue amongst the members of civil society, with a view to improving co-existence, tolerance and mutual understanding. The Union must rationalise, coordinate and facilitate the actions of its instruments, Europol, Eurojust, Cepol and the Situation Centre, and others pursuing the same aims, in order to detect and prevent links between terrorism and other forms of crime. I would ask, Madam President, when drawing up prevention strategies, that the horrendous experiences of the victims be respected and taken into account in particular, as I say in my report. The victims must be acknowledged and protected. Terrorists begin to lose when the victims make the truth of their experiences known and society listens to them. With regard to prevention, Madam President, prevention cannot and must not be used as a missile amongst democratic countries and States. The last time prevention failed was on 30 December 2006 in Madrid. We do not criticise failures in prevention. We work hard to ensure that they never happen again. I shall draw to a close, Madam President. We will only be able to tackle terrorism with determination when all of the democratic countries, together, and the Union in the singular, have a clear view of the threat, and the threat is lethal, permanent and destined to remain with us.
costep_2002-02-04_5_13	Mr President, I would like to refer to Baroness Ludford’s report. Before we deal with other aspects of immigration policy, a common status is needed for third-country nationals who are long-term residents in strict compliance with the Tampere Agreements, the aim of which was to give these third-country nationals a set of uniform rights comparable with those enjoyed by EU citizens. We need to resolve situations such as those that, in theory, hinder the free movement of third-country nationals within the EU today. For this reason my group hopes that this House will send a strong message, directed mainly at the Council, supporting the European Commission proposal. In this regard, I would personally like to thank Baroness Ludford for her work. We cannot accept some of the amendments that have been adopted in Committee or that have been submitted once again to this House. As Mrs Roure mentioned, we cannot allow subjective issues to obstruct the authority to grant this long-term resident status and, even less so, dangerous propaganda exercises that draw parallels, not between border controls and terrorism, as used to be said, but between long-term residents and terrorists, or, at the very least, terrorism. Once again we are going to defend the right for third-country nationals who are long-term residents to vote in local and European elections. I can only hope that, despite the numerous empty places on the Council benches, this message will leave Parliament and be heard.
costep_1999-10-07_5_8	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1980 something happened in Italy, the scale of which, in terms of numbers of victims, made it a disaster. As is typical of Italian justice, 19 years later, nothing has yet been said with any certainty. In relation to this grave episode - and the previous speakers highlighted this - secrecy and doubts have surrounded military bodies, institutions, governments and nations for two decades. The lack of certainty encourages prejudices and vague judgements. The victims, their families and the entire international community have the right to uncover the truth, not in twenty years or more but as quickly as possible. This Parliament must oblige all the States concerned and individual institutions to close this chapter, which is one of the many Italian mysteries where the truth is never found, and which has seen high level involvement and assistance. The Italian and international communities will be grateful to this Parliament and they will regain confidence in the institutions. This will honour the memory of the many innocent victims.
costep_2007-02-13_11_4	In its opinion, the Committee on International Trade emphasised that in the course of reforming the wine sector, the most important thing is for us to make European wine more competitive on international markets as well as on internal markets. This is by no means a simple task, since regulating the wine market is exceptionally complex, and European wineries are struggling with numerous difficulties. One of the very important points in the recommendation by the Committee on International Trade is that support for grubbing up cannot be the central element of the reform. A much more complex regulation is needed than this. In my view, insofar as support is to be given to grubbing up, this must be concentrated on those regions where surplus is currently being produced. For it can be seen that in those regions where production is in deficit - in other words, where they consume more than they produce - or where it is in equilibrium, the growth of imports comes not primarily from wines of other European Union Member States, but from wines of third countries. Therefore, if grubbing up is carried out in those areas which until now have been able to produce enough for their own consumption, but which from now on will no longer be able to do so, it is not at all certain that this will lead to a decrease in the surplus produced within the European Union. It is much more likely that it will lead to an increase in imports from third countries. In addition to these considerations, it is the opinion of the Committee on International Trade that we need to act forcefully in international forums, within the framework of the WTO, that is, in bilateral trade agreements, in the interests of securing protection of geographical indications.
costep_2003-09-25_4_63	No in-depth assessment of the reasons for the failure of the WTO Ministerial Conference at Cancún is provided in the resolution just adopted by the European Parliament. The resolution does not contain clear guidelines for the future either. In particular, it fails to state that: Failure was due to increasingly widespread rejection of the free trade system. It is imperative to work on the creation of fairer rules governing international trade; The European Union acted as a fervent disciple of the doctrine of free trade. It bears a good deal of the responsibility for the failure at Cancún. For instance it insisted on including on the agenda negotiations on the Singapore issues on, inter alia, investments and public procurement in spite of opposition from the developing countries. The Commission bears much of the blame for failure. This is because at these international negotiations the Commission adopted the standard approach it favours when dealing internally with advocates of policies it does not agree with. It simply refuses to communicate with them; Reform of the common agricultural policy as prepared in advance of Cancún is now largely obsolete. I should mention that we opposed it from the outset. The European Union must take account of the most recent information and draft a further reform, which should provide greater protection for our agricultural model.
costep_2003-09-22_1_57	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, let me start by warmly congratulating Mr Sterckx, the author of this report; it is outstanding, it is superb, and I would almost be prepared to accord to it the status of holy writ as regards the safety of ships and maritime transport in the future - provided, of course, that it includes those things for which we are pushing, as it is very comprehensive. We were told, let me remind you, that the Prestige had set off from the Baltic, and that - leaving Austria and Luxembourg out - it had, at least in theory passed by every one of the Member States, so that what happened could have happened anywhere. This means that we need not just technical improvements but also safer shipping lanes. We have been told more than once about the blackspots in the Baltic, such as, for example, the 'Kadetrinne', where what basically happens is that ships end up travelling in the wrong direction, so that near-accidents are an almost daily occurrence. That is why there is an urgent need for mandatory pilotage there, and that is something we want to bring up in this House. It is the Russians who are refusing to accept this, so I would like to see us in this House make explicit reference to it when we vote, and put more pressure on Russia in this matter, as mandatory pilotage is inordinately important. My second point is that there of course have to be emergency measures, with clear responsibilities and adequate provision of tugboats. Perhaps Commissioner De Palacio will again give some thought to what was said at the first meeting about the issue of linking this with compensation, as this may simplify the practical side of any emergency measures. Quite apart from the disasters, we must not forget the mess that is made in European coastal waters on a daily basis. In 2001, 390 oil slicks were illegally deposited in the Baltic, with another 596 in the North Sea. Commissioner, I think it right and proper that you have put something forward about once and for all categorising this as criminal wrongdoing and dealing with it by means of criminal law. Fines are not enough to deal with this; no longer must it be possible to pay them out of the petty cash. Such pollution of the sea is a crime, and must be punished accordingly. Technology, though, is not the decisive factor. I very much welcomed your commencement, in July, of proceedings in respect of infringements of the Treaties against ten Member States that have not yet transposed even the measures decided on after Erika. It is, basically, sad that this should be so. Those ten Member States should be ashamed of themselves, and the country holding the presidency being one of them is a bitter pill to swallow. We need port State control and classification societies. The Member States did not need the accident that befell the Prestige to make that clear to them. That was what we decided post-Erika, and you yourselves all signed up to it. I think, Commissioner, that you will have every support from Parliament in these matters - on which both Parliament and the Council have come to decisions - in pressing for this to be transposed into national law, failing which this whole Council will remain a bunch of hypocrites, and we will be unable to make any promises to the public about safety.
costep_2005-12-15_1_84	The Commission’s legislative programme for 2006 illustrates a concept of Europe that is now obsolete: an antidemocratic Europe, following an underhand ‘plan D’ to force on us a constitution that the French and Dutch rejected; a Europe without borders, open to worldwide immigration, allowing, in particular, the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants regularised in Spain and Italy to settle in other Member States; an antisocial Europe, which, by implementing the ultraliberal Lisbon Strategy, causes our businesses to relocate and dismantles our employment law (the Bolkestein directive, which Mr Chirac promised in April was dead and buried, will once again be put to a vote here in Parliament); a Europe with no identity, which, by opening accession negotiations with Turkey, an Asiatic, Muslim country, will soon be European only in name; an antinational Europe, dissolving our nations into a bureaucratic superstate. Today, our people need not the umpteenth legislative programme, but a different Europe, founded on the principles that identify it: the freedom of its nations and the spirit of its civilisation.

costep_1997-12-16_13_17	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing a proposal by the Commission to make an addition to article 3 of the EC Treaty. According to it, the activity of the Community should include a contribution to supporting services which are oriented to the common good. In my assessment, that is dangerous for integration and competition policy, and in my opinion it must be rejected. Writing it into the treaty would mean that state services of general interest would represent a dimension to which it would no longer be possible to set any limit. Such an article would also have an effect on the Community’s competition rules and regulations, and also on the subsidy regulations, and in contrast to EU policy, which is based on opening up markets and privatization, this is the establishment of monopolies and preferential treatment of public companies, which cannot be in the interests of Europe. We should ask ourselves what really belongs in state services of general interest. I think, as little as possible. In my opinion, the state must fulfil the following tasks, and it is sometimes good to remember them. First, it must ensure internal and external security. Second, it must ensure independent dispensation of justice, and third, it must support the sense of community of society by creating a balance between advantage and disadvantage. Fourth, it must also fill the gaps in public life which are not filled by private business initiative. But it does not have to operate a state airline, a state post and telephone company and a state railway company. Where there is competition, it need not hinder it by introducing customs duties on imports and providing subsidies. The most objective judge of services is and remains the market and not the state. It determines the value of a service through competition. So for a state or society, an urgent task is to organize a market, and not services of general interest. I hope that we will not decide the opposite tomorrow.
costep_2011-06-23_14_316	The need for greater flexibility in the use of funds and for an administrative culture that promotes a multidisciplinary approach and simpler fund administration is vital for establishing a common strategic framework for the Structural Funds. In terms of synergies between the Structural Funds, the European Parliament has insisted on the need to avoid a high concentration of capacity in economic clusters and top European Union regions. I think that an integrated approach is needed between the different sectoral policies in order to achieve the optimum result for economic development and growth, the reduction of development disparities between regions, job creation, improvement in quality of life, worker training for new jobs, social and territorial cohesion and the implementation of the European social model, which is a factor contributing to cohesion and the European economy’s competitiveness. Focusing the funds' joint action at regional or local level enhances their added value and permits stakeholders to fine-tune specific actions to the real economic and social needs and, therefore, to the employment situation in each specific region. This is why I voted in favour of this report.
costep_2001-02-01_3_9	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that the BSE crisis is affecting me both politically and personally. The institutions - in this case the national governments - appear only to react to crises, and never take preventative action, as if history has taught us nothing. For example, Commissioner, you have had a mandate from the Agriculture Council to apply the measures described to us. I wish you luck because I can already imagine the merry dance you will be led when you propose these measures: some Member States will request exemption, others will request an extension, for example for the spinal cord from 12 to 20 months, and others will claim to offer consumers safe meat. So this is all déjà vu to some extent and I can only hope that you have the strength and nerve to stay on course, in the sure knowledge that this will not be easy. What has come to the fore in recent months is a by now familiar subject, namely the monitoring by Member States of the application of Community measures. I feel that this is the real point that should be raised with the Council because the measures to be applied are established but then the Member States either do not apply the measures - hence there are many infringement procedures, but they always take a long time - or are not in a position to implement checks. The result is that, in the end, measures which appear severe have to be taken because the checks do not ensure guarantees or safety in any way. This is something which gives rise to further difficulties because Member States tend to either conduct few checks or, when they do carry out checks, do not communicate the data available to other institutions. Therefore, Commissioner, Parliament will constantly be urging you to action, but you can also count on our support in this uphill task. If I may make an observation: it is a fact that whenever you try to solve a problem, other problems arise. For example, what are we to do with the animal meal? We are to burn it. Of course, it is clear that, even today, we do not have the incineration capacity, and so it is stored. It is also clear that there have been no studies carried out on the environmental impact of the incineration of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of animal meal. A further question is what we should feed to cattle as a protein supplement. Perhaps the Members already know - although it is worth reminding them - that Europe already imports 30 million tonnes of genetically-modified soya derivatives and that the elimination of meal can only increase imports as Europe is soya dependent. So what should our approach be in the face of all this? All that can be said is that there are no miracle cures, but we must be open to finding appropriate solutions on a case by case basis and ensure that we do so.
costep_2000-03-16_3_8	Mr President, before we vote on the Jackson resolution on the Structural Fund programmes, may I draw Parliament’s attention to the French Council of State decree dated 27 September 1999 which cancels the notification of 500 sites that could be designated as special conservation sites and therefore pose a problem. The Commission has not expressed its opinion on that. The Council of State ruled that the procedure had not been respected, i.e. that the mayors and regional and local authorities, organisations and associations concerned had not been consulted. We do not know exactly what the situation is at present. To ensure that Member States are not unjustly penalised, I move that the vote on this report be deferred until the Commission has delivered its reasoned opinion on action to be taken following the Council of State decree. I also think Parliament cannot be both judge and judged.
costep_2000-06-14_4_26	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several speakers have referred to the importance of the European security and defence policy. I should like to confine myself to the question of democratic and parliamentary control of this policy. Peace and security are not suitable subjects for Council meetings in camera. They must be subject to parliamentary control. It is important for decisions on military intervention to remain the responsibility of national parliaments. It is also important for budgetary questions and national defence budgets to continue to be decided in national parliaments. But everything over and above that, all questions of civil policy, come under the jurisdiction of the European Parliament. This European security and defence policy must be subject to parliamentary monitoring in this House. The President-in-Office has said that transparency and clarity are needed. It was clever to pretend that the aim is to integrate the Western European Union in the European Union, which is why the debates currently being held within the Western European Union are so absurd, trying as they are to invent a new identity for the parliamentary assembly of the Western European Union. Every iota of strength is being used at the moment to define new remits, even going so far as a European assembly for security and defence, yet another committee to add to the confusion, rather than to increase transparency. I am reminded of the policy of the Christmas goose trying to postpone Christmas. It would be good if more transparency were to reign here and if we were to come to accept that the European Parliament is the right forum. We attended the NATO assembly a few days ago, where the president of the North Atlantic assembly stated that the Western European Union was merging into the European Union, that the EU had a parliament, that NATO had a parliament and that the WEU assembly therefore had no further raison d' être. I think that is also our position and account should be taken of it at this Summit.
costep_2007-12-10_15_21	Thank you, Mr President. Yet again we have cause for concern about ethnic diversity in the Vojvodina region of Northern Serbia, since in many decisions the European Parliament has declared this to be a value to be protected. In the sense of the Readmission Agreement that was otherwise unfairly forced on Serbia by the European Union, some estimates indicate that many tens of thousands of people who are staying illegally in the integrated Member States will have to be sent back to Serbia. Since the Serbian Government has no strategy for socially and geographically reintegrating this mass, the Serbian Constitution in vain prohibits on paper any changes to the proportions of ethnic groups through settlement if those who are readmitted do not go back to the settlements from which they originally came but to Vojvodina, which is a more developed region. It is no accident that even empty flats here are put on the police list. In addition to this, the locals are rightly fearful of a wave of refugees from Kosovo. The tensions are increased by the military censuses of the recent past, for which the Hungarians of Vojvodina qualify as loyal Serbian citizens but which are regarded as unjustified by a country that is a partner for peace in NATO and that is striving for a peaceful settlement in Kosovo. Thank you, Mr President.
costep_1998-09-16_2_29	Mr President, in my view we need an in-depth analysis of Russia and a search for fundamental remedies for the situation. We must not do this behind closed doors, but through closer dialogue with our Russian partners. We must not repeat the mistakes that have already been made, by exporting prescriptions. I wish to make two points, which seem to me fundamental. Firstly, we are also responsible, as a Parliament, as a European Commission, as an International Monetary Fund, as international organisations, both for underestimating the factors in the crisis and for having accepted, or directly sought, processes which could hardly fail to result in this situation. Secondly, we put unlimited trust in the political leadership and in economic processes which have already been rightly described by Mr Swoboda and Mr Barón Crespo as savage liberalism and speculation dressed up as the construction of a market economy. This is not creating a real market economy - which would be a proper objective - in this country, and the State, which used to be everything, indeed too much, is being dismantled. Of course it needed to be changed and reformed, but now it seems to have been reduced to nothing. We know that public impoverishment is often linked to private enrichment of the few, and it seems to me that this is what is currently happening in the country: public impoverishment is plain to see, and so is private enrichment of the few. We often see evidence of this in our own countries: in recent years there has been an increased flow of Russian tourists - and I am pleased about that - spending more than the Americans spent in the 1950s and 1960s. But there is one small difference: the Americans had the United States behind them, a solid economy and a strong country, and the Russians do not. I do not know if it is true that only 8 % of Russian citizens pay taxes, but this would imply the dismantling of a whole political system: there is no going back, obviously. So we need to rediscover a serious and lasting economic and political approach, and our work together with our Russian partners must be geared to making a concrete contribution which will improve the current situation.
costep_1999-05-04_5_16	Mr President, the offensive currently being conducted against Serbia is quite clearly contrary to international law and is also politically reprehensible. It is flouting with impunity the human rights which those who initiated this attack are constantly talking about and it may degenerate to the detriment of European and perhaps world security. This offensive is clearly contrary to international law. To start with, conventional international law states that a war can be engaged only after having been declared. This was not the case here. From now on the United States Government will not show us the archive footage of the Roosevelt speech after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour. You must remember the quotation - ' a date which will live in infamy' - and all because the American Secretary of State, who knew perfectly well what was happening, hung about for a few hours in the anteroom of the Japanese Ambassador who had just informed him of the declaration of war. His sole purpose in doing this, in American and international public opinion, was to profit from the resulting indignation. The American Government is today reserving this indignation for itself. There have been many other infamies and many have been committed on the initiative of the US Government. This offensive is also clearly contrary to the United Nations Charter which explicitly states that the use of force, except in the case of legitimate defence, is subject to the authorisation of the Security Council. This requirement was cast aside with incredible cynicism and in defiance of this basic international law. The Security Council’s authorisation was not requested because we knew that it would not have been granted. This offensive is also contrary to the NATO Charter, that is, the North Atlantic Treaty. NATO was a purely defensive alliance to begin with and has been converted for this particular conflict into an offensive alliance which is intervening outside its geographical sphere of action, since Yugoslavia has never fallen within the ambit of NATO. These are the violations of the laws involved. But political morality is under attack too. By encouraging the secession of the Kosovar Albanians, who have not always been innocent themselves of violent acts, we are consequently justifying just what we are condemning and in particular the actions of Milosevic’s government. If the Albanian claims to Kosovo are founded on the basis of the rights of an ethnic majority, then Milosevic had good grounds in claiming for Serbia the annexation of Croatian Krajina, populated in the main by Serbs, or the annexation of part of Bosnia, also partly populated by Serbs. We have to choose one way or the other. If ethnic rights are to form the basis, then clearly everyone must have their share of the cake and an international conference will be needed to redefine the borders. On the other hand, and this is my opinion, if we insist on respect for the international borders as a fundamental principle of security in international relations, then this principle cannot be just cast aside. Finally, in terms of human rights, we are right to feel sorry for the fate of the unfortunate refugees but the number of refugees has increased massively since the intervention and the comprehensive bombing, or if their numbers were as high as was claimed before the NATO intervention, how is it that no plans were made to accommodate them? We are clearly being brainwashed. This issue is being dominated by lies and one-sided propaganda, as we have seen in other cases. The US Government is really imposing its protectorate on Europe. No doubt Mr Clinton is also using this bloody video game to make people forget about the sexual shenanigans in the White House. As a man, a politician and an officer, I am ashamed today to be European.
costep_2007-11-29_5_6	Mr President, I believe that this is a good example of the proper functioning of the European institutions. Despite our institutional complexity, the Parliament, the Commission and the Council are all working well on this matter and I hope that, with a satisfactory vote at this Parliamentary session, we can achieve a resolution at first reading, without any further delay. I am grateful to Mr Frattini for facilitating the outcome and to the rapporteur for all his hard work in arriving at this agreement. As has been said more than once, the focus of our discussions here has been Article 5, which relates to the protection of consumer rights. In contractual matters, the consumer is not in a situation of equality; normally he is at a disadvantage. To give a simple example, take a person who has to sign a car rental contract at an airport: the consumer is not able to read the content of the contract, he is unaware of the law to which the contract is subject and, unless he has legal protection he is completely in the hands of the person offering the contract. This proposal for a regulation aims, without sacrificing the principles governing choice of the applicable law, to secure a system of protection for the consumer and this is now reflected in the formula - suggested by the Council - whereby the choice of law may not entail for the consumer the loss of the protection provided under the inalienable contractual provisions of the law which, in the absence of choice, would have been applicable under paragraph 1. Generally speaking, the main problem here in the European Union is the lack of harmonisation of substantive law. These formulae applying the law of conflict are merely subsidiary formulae and we hope that the Commission will pursue its legislative drive by proposing texts offering the consumer material protection which is uniform throughout the European Union, thereby removing the need to resort to these complicated conflict-of-law provisions.
costep_2010-02-10_8_39	I would like to begin by saying that I consider the reports on Croatia and Macedonia to be good and well-prepared reports and I think we should applaud the work of the rapporteurs and back the adoption of the reports. As far as Turkey is concerned, I get the feeling that we are playing hide and seek in this area. The Turkish authorities outwardly declare efforts to change but in the real world, there is little change in society. Fathers still sell their daughters or swap them for cattle. The men who buy wives treat them like slaves. I firmly believe that the process of convergence of civilisations will be complicated and lengthy and it will be simple neither for us nor for Turkish society. I therefore think that in this case, we must arm ourselves with patience and we must be prepared for long negotiations but, in these negotiations, we must act correctly and honourably and speak openly about all of the problems. It is in our interests and also in the interests of the Turkish people, and when this problem is sorted out and brought to a successful conclusion, it will be an achievement both for Europe and for Turkey.
costep_2003-10-23_1_121	Mr President, Commissioner, and the few honourable Members who are present, I am going to be very brief and I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mrs Figueiredo, on her report. The uniform application of the CFP in all the Member States is an important challenge, undoubtedly, and we must therefore also congratulate the European Commission on its proposal. There can be no sound fisheries policy without real and effective control in which the fisheries sector itself also participates. New technologies allow for better and greater control, and they must be used to improve compliance with the common fisheries policy. This control must not relate exclusively to fishing itself, but it must also, and this is very important, be extended to the other phases of the process, in other words, to the chain of marketing, transport, sales and so forth, also including controls in catering establishments. We therefore all agree that more homogeneity, more rationality, more resources and more budget are required. I will dedicate the rest of the time available to me to a few brief comments on the report by Mrs McKenna since, although our group had requested a joint debate on these reports, this has not been the case. I congratulate the rapporteur and I am pleased that, both in the annual report by the Commission and in the report by Parliament, it is stressed that just four Member States have complied 100% with the requirements for the corresponding boxes in all segments of the fleet. These States are: Finland, Denmark, Spain and Portugal. In other words, there are 11 States which are not complying with them, and that is the most important thing in my view, together with the clear fact - and allow me to point this out as a Spanish person - that Spain is one of them. In this way I hope to counter, and I would like to make this clear, certain attempts to slander and discredit the Spanish fisheries sector. Spain, however, is one of only four States, I repeat, which comply with the fleet-reduction plans, and I believe it is necessary to stress this here, in the presence of other States and therefore of other representatives of other Member States which are non-compliant.
costep_1998-02-20_5_10	Mr President, it is an undeniable fact that there has been malpractice in the area of grain export subsidies in the Union area. This is one of the cankers in our agricultural policy, quite apart from cases of malpractice in the meat trade. It is, for example, quite unbelievable that free market grain and intervention grain could have been stored together. As Mr Giansily’s report suggests, we should look at the maize quotas for Spain and Portugal. It is obvious that imported maize is, at least in Portugal, being mixed with EU maize at considerable profit. The fault in the system does not end there but also crops up in Agenda 2000 negotiations. We obviously try to eliminate the possibility of malpractice there by making the cultivation of maize more profitable in the European Union area. When it is a matter of zero-sum games being played with agriculture in the EU or a spiralling dive to fund enlargement, we pass the problem of maize quotas in Agenda 2000 talks on to Finnish dairy farmers. It will not do. We cannot make our farmers pay for other people’s abuse, Mr Fischler.
costep_1998-07-14_8_18	Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Anastassopoulos for his excellent work. We do indeed need to have common principles in the electoral procedure for elections to this House. One of those should be full respect for proportionality. But there is also a need for all the peoples who make up the European Union, all the national identities, to have the ability to send their own elected representatives to this Parliament. And where different nations, different peoples, live together in a single Member State - as in the case of the Spanish state where Basques, Catalans and others are all of us nations comprising a state - that plurality needs to be reflected when it comes to establishing the European Parliament’s electoral constituencies. For those of us who believe in a federal European project, it is important that the people should feel that Europe is close to them, as something they can identify with. Establishing territorial constituencies brings Europe closer to its citizens and the reality of their national and cultural lives. That is why the report’s proposed Article 2 is important, establishing that each Member State shall set up territorial constituencies, with these essentially being compulsory for countries with a population of more than 20 million, the ones where this lack of territorial representation is most apparent. Some governments, such as the Spanish Government, are opposed to their country’s domestic plurality being reflected in the construction of Europe. That is an archaic, centralist view, which reflects apprehension about Basque or Catalan actualities, or others, being reflected in European politics. But they have nothing to fear. We do not want a presence in Europe in order to destroy anything, but to build a common European space. We are going to contribute and collaborate with solidarity to the European project, which can be the reflection and multicultural sum of us all - not just French, Spanish and British, but also Catalan, Basque, Scottish, Welsh and so forth. So creating territorial constituencies for the European elections can and should be a step towards achieving a Europe for everybody, in which all its peoples can participate.
costep_1998-05-27_11_6	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the matter raised in Mrs Van Lancker’s report merits our full attention. When, in this very House, we debate problems that focus on the lack of harmonization, for example, in the sizing of processed peas, the capacity of moped engines or the speed of forestry tractors, we tend to overlook those citizens who, whether nationals or frontier residents in a Member State, are unable to work in the adjoining Member State without coming up against insurmountable administrative, social or tax problems. What are we to think in an age when trade, electronic interaction, professional and geographical mobility on a world scale are becoming commonplace, how do we view a European Union that professes lofty principles, in this case the abolition of all domestic borders, yet fails to broach problems of stewardship. It is a sensitive problem and even the euro, the alleged panacea for all our problems, offers no relief. Different and frequently complex social regimes exist within our individual Member States. We therefore need a strong political will and a genuine desire to promote the common good in order to confront the problems posed in this area. In the preambles to her report, Mrs Van Lancker quite rightly referred to the many petitions that our committee responsible handles in this respect. Thus, for instance, the many cases of dual taxation in the state of residence and in the state of employment, or non-payment of various allowances because the citizens reside in another Member State. It is indecent to appeal throughout the report for more resources to assist the mobility of citizens of the Member States or to claim the creation of a citizens' Europe when those very citizens, on a daily or weekly basis, cross domestic borders and face staggering problems. We might add to this those situations where Community nationals face difficulties due to the lack of coordination on the position of Member States in their bilateral agreements with other states. Once again, there is no shortage of examples, especially in Switzerland. In France, for example, the committee for the defence of frontier workers in the Upper Rhine throws up many examples, such as that of the Italian national who worked and paid his dues for 25 years in France, followed by two years in Switzerland and who, falling victim to a disability, lost his claim for compensation because of the last two years since he is Italian and therefore not covered by the Franco-Swiss bilateral agreement. Ladies and gentlemen, let us not forget that in the first instance, we are the elected members responsible for promoting the common good. Europe will not be built on large coalitions, declarations of intent and self-congratulation, but by the day-to-day approval of its members, I mean individuals and whole peoples. This is because we will know, when we acquire the legal and technical jurisdiction, how to listen to them and solve their problems and they, in turn, will be able to listen to us and understand.
costep_2000-07-07_2_2	We know that short sea shipping is an integral part of the European transport system. However, as the Commission report and the report of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism point out, short sea shipping is suffering from a poor public image in terms of its cost, slowness and inefficiency. Nevertheless, this image no longer corresponds to the real situation and this mode of transport can provide solutions to global problems which are prevalent in this area in Europe. I am thinking about traffic congestion problems, and high infrastructure and environmental costs. During the last few years, progress has also been made and there has been a real increase in short sea shipping: from 1990 to 1997, a 17% increase in the tonnage transported and a 23% increase in the number of tonnes per kilometre. While there is no doubt about its success, this mode of transport has not yet reached its full potential and maximised its hidden advantages: advantages in terms of cost since it is the most economical mode of transport; advantages in terms of the amount of energy consumed per tonne/kilometre; advantages in terms of efficiency since it is the most efficient mode of transport from the point of view of the amount of investment required in relation to transport capacity; advantages in terms of regional cohesion since it is the most suitable mode for servicing the peripheral regions of Europe; advantages in terms of the environment since it causes less pollution than mainland traffic; and advantages in terms of intermodal transport since it is an ideal way of developing multimodal transport. We must therefore act quickly in order to contribute to its development. In particular, we will have to develop joint investment programmes. One of the priorities will have to be to increase the efficiency of port operations and reduce waiting times in ports. I would stress the fact that the public authorities have a major role to play at regional level, as well as national and European level. However, two points in my fellow Member’s report pose a problem for me. They concern the proposal which seeks to draw up a list of ports which are particularly suitable for short sea shipping. Drawing up such a list seems unnecessary to me and, in particular, runs the risk of penalising those ports which are not yet entirely suitable, but which are being converted for this purpose. Moreover, a 'onestopshop' approach to the transport logistics services offered to end users is proposed. While I am in favour of the idea that we need to find the means to set up an information system, I am against the service being centralised by a large port, which is already in a dominant market position. Finally, I would have liked the report to have included the proposal made by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, according to which short sea shipping must be considered neither as an alternative to road transport nor as a competitive system. The European Commission should therefore develop an intermodal strategy to achieve complementarity between the modes of transport. In this context and with this in mind, the Member States should harmonise current legislation in order to prevent it from representing an obstacle to continuity between short sea shipping and mainland traffic, particularly as regards the total weight of rolling stock. The proposal which is being put forward to us today therefore represents an important step in the right direction in the area of short sea shipping. However, we still have a long way to go.
costep_2003-03-11_2_107	Madam President, the economic doctrine of the European Union in general and this report in particular create an impression of total disassociation between, on the one hand, declarations of principle, good intentions and an honourable debate on employment, and, on the other, the terrible, distressing social reality of global competition and the economic war. Of course, we all recognise that encouraging investment and enterprise fosters job creation; that reducing fiscal pressure and bureaucratic constraints boosts activity; and that training young people and older people to enable them to enter or remain in the world of work is a good thing. Having broken down these open doors, however, having explained that, in addition to employment and growth, a third, environmental dimension is required, not to mention the objective of promoting health and well-being in the workplace, having listed all these good intentions, we must wake up, leave behind our daydreams and come back to reality. And that is a severe shock: instability, social plans, delocalisation, social dumping, increasing unemployment, mass immigration, falling growth, demographic collapse and a social protection system about to implode. We owe all of that to a European political class that has managed to combine the problems of bureaucratic socialism with the problems of ultra-liberalism and globalisation. In other words, we are struggling with the worst of both worlds. Furthermore, it is clear that eastward enlargement will now throw the doors wide open to large-scale delocalisation and mass immigration. It is clear that the Union’s economic policy of opening up its internal market to global competition is selling off what is left of our labour-intensive industries. Allowing irresponsible free-trade extremists and globalisation fundamentalists to take charge of the future of our economies and our social structures is dangerous. Economic and social recovery is to be achieved through the recovery of our internal markets, through national and Community preference, through national and Community protection and by redefining WTO trade rules, and certainly not within the framework of the terrible nation-grinding machine that the European Union has now become.
costep_2006-11-29_15_5	Mr President, Commissioner, in the debate that we are having at present, it is important not to get everything mixed up and not to confuse all the various responsibilities. Acting, as we are, at European Union level, we must demonstrate the resources available to us at this level in order to contribute to the best possible solution to problems of this kind, whether in the metalworking industry or in other branches of activity. As you said, Commissioner, just now when you began to speak, there are two aspects. On the one hand, there are the companies and, if we want employment at EU level to be maintained over time, we need successful companies. On the other hand, there are the employees, who are in need of help. Through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and very soon, I hope, the European Monetary Fund (EMF), the European Union has the resources to help every worker individually with re-training, returning to work or starting his or her own business. This customised help provided by the European Union needs to be publicised by the media when you issue your communications so that our fellow Europeans might be fully aware of the action taken by the EU. What is more, it is crucial, as you have said, to be able to respond promptly. If a number of sectors of the automobile industry - at present, it is Volkswagen - need our funds, the important thing is to help the employees extremely swiftly so that the aid we offer is genuinely useful and enables them to find other jobs quickly.
costep_2010-12-15_5_16	Mr President, I am happy to answer that question. The Irish Government made the mistake of giving guarantees without demanding reform of the banking sector. That was irresponsible and that is why it now has a budget deficit of 32%. We know that. However, you should not confuse the problems of other states with those of Ireland. Ireland is a completely different case, because it concerns the second level of the banking crisis and not a structural problem, as in other countries. Mr Schulz, you know that as well as I do. Please do not attempt to distract our attention. The speaker agreed to take a question under the 'blue card' procedure (Rule 149(8 of the Rules of Procedure)).
costep_2006-10-23_17_9	Mr President, the very serious problem of emigration, particularly by women, due to increasing globalisation and the complexities of contemporary life should also be considered from the point of view of the irreparable damage to their countries of origin. In addition I must mention the problem of increasing poverty in countries exploited by rich and highly developed ones. There are certainly ways in which the opportunity to leave one’s homeland can prove positive. Nonetheless, emigrants are cut off from a community bound together by its history, traditions and culture. An individual who could have contributed to increasing the common good leaves. When that person starts life all over again in a foreign culture and language, he or she is working for the benefit of another society. Such people are often exploited because of their circumstances. That is why it is vital to have the relevant legislation in place, particularly regarding social protection and the individual’s right to work. The document under debate goes some way towards emphasising this. An appropriate scale of values is also important, where moral values are also given a place alongside purely material gain, and human labour is considered in the broader sense of the word, although the latter should not mean interference in the personal lives of women who want to have children and bring up families.
costep_2003-06-03_2_173	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a proposal for reform, however comprehensive, will never be able to satisfy the many different farming systems in Europe. It was therefore inevitable that the debate would become heated and even change in tone according to the different viewpoints of the Members. To get straight to the point which interests me, I would like to say that I come from the mountains, and in this debate I want to express the opinion of those who live and work in mountain regions. We endorse the transition from market, in other words from production, to farm, and we also endorse the proposal to transfer the savings made through modulation to rural development. Despite the many instances of reluctance to address mountain concerns, despite the fact that the mountains are not mentioned anywhere in this reform, we can say that there is hope on the horizon. At last, for the first time, multifunctionality, which is indispensable for some disadvantaged peripheral areas, is treated quite seriously. Multifunctionality has always been practised in mountain areas where, together with their primary activity, farmers are required to control forestry development, channel watercourses, concern themselves with animal welfare and look after the environment for the benefit of farm and other tourism. This also means taking the greatest possible care to ensure the quality of typical products and niche products, which have for some time been highly successful and not unprofitable on the market. This too could help to convince a young farmer or two not to abandon the mountains. It is not enough, however: multifunctional farming brings added value to the community and it is therefore right that there should be appropriate remuneration. The ridiculous premiums for meadow mowing are not enough: a decent, fixed, supplementary income should be provided for those who work in the mountains and perform these services for the benefit of all. Otherwise, the exodus already taking place will continue and depopulation of the mountains will be the inevitable result.
costep_2005-04-14_1_122	Mr President, I was prepared to add my name to a list of speakers and not to begin a debate. In any event, it is the case that this joint resolution that we are going to approve on the situation of the refugees in the Sahara is self-explanatory and deals with a strictly humanitarian drama. When dealing with the situation of human rights in the world, we will find a paragraph on the situation in the Sahara. Moreover, the political situation in the Sahara warrants further consideration. The strictly humanitarian situation is what we are dealing with now, however. We are talking about around 200 000 refugees who have been living in refugee camps for almost 30 years and whose only resource is international humanitarian aid. That is what we are talking about today. That, moreover, is what is in jeopardy for various reasons, including some purely bureaucratic reasons affecting the European Commission. All of this is on the point of creating a genuine humanitarian crisis. That is what this motion for a resolution is intended to deal with, calling urgently on the Commission to adopt a series of measures to prevent a humanitarian crisis of unforeseeable proportions. Furthermore, certain very specific measures are proposed, such as better cooperation with non-governmental organisations on the ground and greater support for the Sahrawi institutions which, within the refugee camps, cooperate in the administration of that humanitarian aid, which, I would emphasise, is the only source of income for 200 000 people. There is no question but that this resolution only resolves and deals with part of the problem and that we cannot turn a blind eye to the fundamental problem. There is a serious problem on Europe’s doorstep, and sooner or later we will have to exert every possible political and diplomatic pressure on the various players involved in resolving this conflict so that we can put an end to the need for debates such as this one as soon as possible: how we can feed 200 000 people who, without us, will have nothing to eat.
costep_2007-06-19_13_9	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are now conducting a mid-term review of the great efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and the assessment is poor - that much emerges clearly from Mrs Kinnock’s report. My group supports this good report most emphatically. If the political situation continues like this, many developing countries, particularly in Africa, will not achieve the Millennium Development Goals and most industrialised countries will not keep their promises to provide financial assistance. Unfortunately, the G8 Summit in Heiligendamm in Germany was one more example of this. Since 1999, at two-year intervals, the same promises have been made and broken time and again. This casts doubt on the credibility of the European Union in the eyes of many developing countries. The promises made in Heiligendamm are now being offset against the promises made in Gleneagles. Sixty billion US dollars for the Global Fund, but we are being told that that will be offset against the broken promises from Gleneagles. This is what is known as double-entry book-keeping. It is an attempt to cause confusion with figures without obligating individual countries. I thought it was very good that the Commissioner expressed himself very clearly in this connection: that is precisely what is needed. It is Parliament’s responsibility to state things clearly and exert the pressure needed to ensure that at least the European Union keeps to its progressive plan for achieving the 0.7% target for Official Development Assistance by 2015 exactly and without book-keeping tricks.
costep_1999-02-12_1_10	Madam President, concerning pages 29 and 30 of the Minutes in the French version, the president of the sitting - Mr Martin, I think it was - reported that the Conference of Presidents had decided to bring forward the Brussels mini-session from 24 and 25 March to 22 and 23 March. I should like to repeat here what I said at the Conference of Presidents on behalf of my group. We find this decision neither opportune nor legally correct. It is not opportune because the calendar was set long ago, was adopted by the plenary, and this change has not been put to the House. I am not sure that it is really the place of the Conference of Presidents to change the calendar which has been agreed. The fact that the summit is scheduled for 24 and 25 March in Berlin is no reason to bring the part-session forward and make us decide our position at all costs in advance of that summit. And legally speaking, I am surprised that the Committee on Budgetary Control, one of Parliament’s committees, should have been sidestepped in this matter. The report we asked for from the committee of experts is part of the consequences of our withholding the discharge for 1996. It runs parallel to the procedure normally followed here. The Committee on Budgetary Control, under the annex to the Rules of Procedure which lays down the powers and responsibilities of the committees, has sole responsibility for all questions concerning the implementation of budgets and all questions concerning the financial management of the Commission. It thus has responsibility for giving an opinion - under paragraph 11 of the annex in question - for giving its opinion to Parliament before the House decides its position. The group of experts does not have to put itself in the hands of the political groups. It must first put itself in the hands of the appropriate members of the Committee on Budgetary Control. That is why I regard this decision as neither opportune nor legally sound. Applause
costep_2009-05-07_7_4	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, in 1999 the European Union adopted a directive banning asbestos from 1 January 2005, but permitting a derogation for diaphragms used for existing electrolysis cells until they reached the end of their service life. This derogation, which had to be re-examined before 1 January, was intended to enable the companies concerned to make plans to stop using asbestos. Here we are today, with an 18-month delay; it is therefore time that we made progress. It is true that, as part of the review of Annex XVII to REACH, the Commission is proposing to extend the current ban on the use and marketing of asbestos fibres and products containing these fibres, but it is maintaining the option for asbestos to be used in factory-based electrolysis installations, with no time limit imposed, even though asbestos-free alternatives do exist and are used by many companies. Moreover, the Commission is adopting a provision that permits the placing on the market of articles containing asbestos in accordance with a system that could vary from one country to another. This is unacceptable, since the use of this product is responsible for a large number of illnesses linked to exposure to asbestos fibres. Furthermore, the number of people succumbing to these illnesses is likely to continue to rise over the next few years, as this product was still being used up until a few years ago. The effects of asbestos on health have long been known. I would add that the Commission’s decision undermines certain REACH provisions, not least the principle of substitution; it is a bad signal that has been sent out to the other companies. The current economic crisis cannot justify this extension. Furthermore, this position of the Commission’s, which has the backing of a majority of Member States at the Council, is inconsistent with the European Union’s position, which aims to introduce a worldwide ban on asbestos. I have one last point before I finish: the European Trade Union Confederation is today maintaining that it was not consulted on the matter and is suggesting that only the opinion of certain companies was heard and taken on board. The Commission, for its part, is claiming the opposite. Could you shed some light on this point for us?
costep_2002-07-01_1_53	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome both the Commission’s initiatives on biofuels. Plans to apply reduced rates of excise duty to biofuels or to exempt them from duties altogether, and to provide for the promotion of their use with a catalogue of clear objectives, will help to reduce the European Union’s high degree of dependency on oil imports in an environmentally sound manner. From here on in, though, I propose to confine myself to the proposal on the promotion of biofuels. My heartfelt thanks go primarily to our rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso González, not only for submitting an excellent draft report, but also for her really good cooperation. The promotion of biofuels fits into the EU’s overall strategy of doubling the penetration of renewable energy sources by 2010, a strategy for which we have essential reasons. In Kyoto, the EU made the commitment to reduce the output of greenhouse gases by 8%. Traffic in particular is a major source of these. It is likewise important to safeguard security of supply, and promoting the biomass as a source of energy will give rural development new and significant impetus. Speaking as I do for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I therefore welcome the responsible Committee’s confirmation of the line taken by the Commission, that binding national targets should be set for further increasing the share of biofuels. I have, however joined with the rapporteur in tabling a compromise amendment providing for indicative targets to be linked with the possibility of their being reviewed. The rapporteur has gone into the background to this. The one thing we now see as important is that we should meet the Council halfway by being willing to set indicative targets as well, but this means that we expect the Council, this very week, to accede to the demands made by the competent Committee in various areas. It is important in this context that environmental and climatic conditions should come under particular scrutiny, that agricultural practices should be examined accordingly, and that it is not in the least acceptable for the Council to do as it is no doubt currently trying to do, and provide for any Member State to be able to opt out without substantial obstacles being put in the way of their doing so. What are we to do with a directive that starts by setting targets and then makes them more lenient? We are, then, prepared to come to a speedy agreement - indeed, the whole point is that we desire one - but such an agreement is not to be had at any price. We hope to have reached agreement with the Council by Thursday.
costep_2005-09-29_1_74	I wish briefly to point out that there is no paragraph calling for urgent measures to support sectors that are being seriously damaged by the rise in fuel prices. Quite the opposite, it stresses the ‘importance of avoiding political intervention’. I wish to point out that following the issues raised by fishermen regarding the consequences of fuel price rises for the fisheries sector, the Council of Ministers on Agriculture and Fisheries of 19 and 20 September inexplicably only once ‘took note’ of the situation and failed to decide on a single measure to address the problem. As the fishermen have warned, the rise in fuel prices has triggered massive problems for the sector. Many vessels will become unusable unless immediate action is taken, such as financial support to restrict fuel price rises. Let me add that fuel increases have served to exacerbate the already difficult situation of many fishermen using traditional methods, who use petrol in the course of their work and do not receive any support to offset the impact of the successive increases in the cost of this fuel. Urgent action is therefore required, in addition to other long-term measures.
costep_2008-03-13_3_22	Women’s freedom to make their own choices is a simple human right. It helps the economy to grow and social protection to improve. Mortality amongst women in developing countries is still tragically and unacceptably high. Families are destroyed as a result. There is a direct link here with child labour. Investing in equal opportunities and freedom means investing in the future, in Europe and in the developing world. Along with my Group I find it shocking that in this House a whole lot of ultraconservative amendments, aimed at curtailing women’s rights, have been tabled to Mrs Uca’s excellent and comprehensive report. These are not really about choices in pregnancy, that is pure hypocrisy. They are about scrapping all references to even the most moderate UN texts on women’s rights. But sexual freedom and reproductive rights guarantee freedom of choice for every woman. Even the Vatican will recognise that freedom one day. But women cannot afford to wait; the world cannot afford to wait.
costep_2010-03-25_11_150	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to European regulations that have laid down firm rules on the quality of agricultural produce, the health of citizens, environmental sustainability, and the specific characteristics of crops, we can say today with pride that European agriculture is a model without equal in the world. While, on the one hand, farmers who have applied the rules with a great sense of duty must be thanked, we must, on the other hand, ask ourselves why the European Union sometimes tends to become tangled up in bureaucratic knots that are liable to eclipse this excellence and to simply create a great sense of disappointment among citizens. Hence why, today, our citizens start their day with a good orange juice without oranges, and for lunch drink rosé wine made by mixing red and white wine fermented by adding sugar with their pizza containing mozzarella made with casein. With no sense of fondness, they can always resort to chocolate without cacao. Not even children are exempt from the consequences of the schizophrenic destruction of our high quality foodstuffs: in Europe, we run the risk of consuming spoiled products of whose provenance we are unaware; one need only mention the melamine-tainted milk from China. Citizens have the right to protection. In order to allow consumers to make informed choices, we must insist that labels be complete and comprehensive and that products for mass consumption, such as long-life sterilised or UHT cow’s milk and dairy products derived exclusively from cow’s milk, carry an indication of the origin of the raw milk used in production, as well as other legally required indications.
costep_2002-09-02_1_21	Mr President, this summer, as I was on my way along the Rome-Naples motorway to Rome airport, I stopped in Cassino. Near Cassino, there is a small hamlet with 2000 residents, San Pietro in Fine, which was razed to the ground at the famous Battle of Cassino during the Second World War. Not one stone of this hamlet, San Pietro in Fine, remained standing, and the few surviving inhabitants rebuilt the village a little way further up the valley. It is my belief that young people should know what happened. To this end, San Pietro in Fine should be made a memorial which is a reminder of the horrors of war and commemorates the major role played by the European Union in the past 50 years in preventing war in Europe.
costep_2005-09-05_1_19	Mr President, the plane crash on 14 August involving a low-cost Cypriot airline claimed the lives of 121 people. In a small country like Cyprus, the human loss has been devastating and I would like to thank you, Mr President, and all my colleagues for the condolences offered to the families of the victims. While an investigation into the exact cause of the crash is under way, it would appear from leaked official reports that long-standing organisational errors and administrative shortcomings may have rendered the Cyprus Civil Aviation Department incapable of fulfilling adequately its role as an aviation safety service. Although the Government of Cyprus has committed itself to corrective measures immediately, it is now clear that the Commission has been aware of this situation for some time and has kept largely quiet and chosen to follow a slow and rather ineffective course of remedial action. Civil aviation authorities in other Member States may have similar safety-related problems, and corrective measures may be needed urgently. I hope that when the Commission makes a statement in this House later on tonight, it will be persuasively clear of its intention to tighten up urgently its watchdog role over the civil aviation authorities and to make sure that transparency is strictly applied.
costep_2003-06-03_2_80	Mr President, last night, I dreamed that the Italian, French, German and Portuguese Ministers for Finance and the Finance Ministers of other countries said to me: 'You see, Mr Fatuzzo? Mr Belder’s report on macro-financial assistance provides for aid to be given to states which need money for their budgets. Can it be a good thing to have a budget deficit, then? Why do we not do the same here in Europe - we can reward those who have a deficit and launch an infringement procedure against the states which manage to balance their books?' I put the question to the House.
costep_2003-03-12_3_78	Services and, in particular, public services, are the key issue, not only because they represent two-thirds of European GDP, but also because they affect the very heart of the identity of a people and their culture. So should we privatise and commoditise the world’s public goods such as health, literacy, knowledge and water? According to the WTO, the answer is yes. Everything is a commodity. According to the European Commission, the answer is also yes, but a whispered yes, because, ideologically, Brussels subscribes to the philosophy of the 'libertarians' who believe in selling everything, even the police, the army and humanitarian affairs, through ECHO. People pretend that they want to preserve cultural diversity. It seems that culture and audio-visual media cannot be treated as commodities, while agriculture, which is the foundation of civilisation, has been in the hands of the market since the Uruguay Round. It has also been said that no liberalisation offer has been made by Europe in the fields of health, education or audio-visual media. However, US intellectual 'fast food' chains are already buying a university in Madrid. The audio-visual media of Berlusconi, Bouygues and Murdoch are a commodity. There is also water, which the former Director-General of the IMF, Mr Camdessus, says is a major factor in corruption, particularly in France with Lyonnaise des Eaux. The confidential nature of the negotiations, the uncertainty regarding the services concerned and the hair-splitting regarding the distinction between globalised trade and nationalised regulation makes GATS an agreement made behind the backs of the people.
costep_2000-12-13_1_34	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the difficulties of finding a compromise have already been mentioned during the course of this debate. It appears that the final solution is acceptable because it reconciles the need for competition with liberalisation and, most importantly, with the obligation for a universal service, and we know that there will be subsequent stages which will make it possible to assess the situation. I particularly welcomed the fact that the reference to postal services in rural areas was accepted in committee. It was no coincidence that I tabled an amendment which also mentions the problems of mountains and islands. I am making particular reference to mountainous areas, even though they do not always fall within the definition of rural regions, because, observing the development of the postal system in many European countries, the question of mountains is now one of the most difficult matters to resolve. If we were to analyse the data already available to us, we would probably discover that a great deal, hundreds, maybe thousands of post offices have been closed in mountainous areas. Clearly, over and above the evaluations of the economic quality of the system which always have to be carried out, the real risk is that the mountainous areas will become marginalised, and new solutions therefore have to be sought which make it possible to maintain an essential service such as the postal service, enhanced by other services. In my opinion, this will be one of the major issues affecting the development of the European mountainous areas in the coming years.
costep_1997-07-16_7_2	Thank you, Madam President, for giving me the floor, pursuant to Rule 129, to move that the report be referred back to committee. I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Cot on his election as Vice-President. I am moving referral on three counts: first of all, because the debate in the Committee on Budgets was guillotined and amendments were not tabled to the motion for a resolution even though it is quite separate from the interinstitutional agreement. Secondly, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has not been consulted. Yet it obviously has competence, in application of Annex VI, I-1, of the Rules, for questions relating to the European Union’s CFSP. Thirdly - and the most serious reason, Madam President - the institutional committee was not consulted. It should have issued its opinion at its meeting of 1 and 2 July, but the item was not even on the agenda. No text was distributed at that meeting and no vote was held. I have witnesses who are members of that committee. Those are the reasons for my request.
costep_2005-04-11_1_44	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, earlier the President asked us to observe a minute’s silence in memory of Pope John Paul II. Taking my cue from this significant occasion, I should like to call upon the European Parliament to work together with the Apostolic See to organise a conference on employment, to be held before the end of the year. The issue of employment, which is a major problem faced by Europe, the European Union and the whole world, was very dear to the heart of the Polish Pope, who believed that help should always be given to unemployed people. I believe that this issue is one that could unite both believers and non-believers, and by believers I mean both Catholics and those of other faiths. It is for this reason that I am calling upon the European Parliament to hold a conference of this kind this year in conjunction with the Apostolic See. I believe that this would also be a fitting tribute to such a great man.
costep_2000-07-06_5_18	Mr President, the Commission report, which I have read in great detail, says: In general terms Directive 92/85/EEC has been well implemented by the Member States and this is reflected in the low level of complaints about the rights of pregnant workers received by the Commission. The rapporteur has set this all to one side, effectively saying it is irrelevant, claiming that the original directive just did not go far enough. I like some of the suggestions in her report. I congratulate her for the enthusiasm with which she has pursued her agenda. But in general it is not a health and safety agenda. It is very much a traditional socialist agenda. Firstly, her report aims to harmonise social policy across the EU rather than leave the detail to Member States - a point made with great force by Mr Olle Schmidt earlier in this debate. Secondly, it wants to improve the terms and conditions of employment for pregnant workers and new mothers by way of extra maternity leave and specified minimum pay levels. Neither of these are really health and safety issues. She is proposing solutions for which there is no health and safety problem. As British Conservatives we confirm our concern about health and safety for all workers, especially vulnerable groups. We confirm our commitment to subsidiarity regarding terms and conditions of employment. But we also confirm our concern to help more women into jobs rather than putting up further barriers to female employment. Hence we urge the House to reject the report.
costep_2009-12-16_12_3	Mrs Malmström, thank you for your excellent reply. We are, of course, talking about three regions: two border regions - Vojvodina and the southern Serbian region of Preševo, in other words a tri-border area. I would also like to ask you, in your future role as Commissioner, to ensure that these countries are developed further within the framework of the cross-border support programme. Inner Serbia, in particular the Sandžak of Novi Pazar, is, of course, completely cut off. This area must also be supported in order to improve the economic conditions so as to help resolve the problems in relation to the minorities. However, there is a great deal of violence in southern Serbia in particular. I would ask the Council to continue to address this explosive situation.
costep_2003-10-23_1_139	Mr President, in this debate I shall focus exclusively on the alarm raised by the Commission amongst European tobacco growers further to its hare-brained proposal for reform of the sector. One might well wonder if it really is so difficult to understand the President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers. I refer to Mr Alemanno, the Italian Minister. He spoke eloquently about the social importance of retaining this crop, notably in Spain, Greece and Italy. Tobacco imports into the European Union are bound to increase. The President of the Agriculture Council has argued along these lines. The Spanish Agriculture Minister is of the same opinion. So too are the authorities in my constituency, Extremadura. It is one of the regions set to suffer most if this body blow to rural society is actually delivered. I would point out yet again that the move could have devastating consequences for the region. Some 20 000 families would be affected. Loss of income would be of the order of EUR 200 million. I must also state that no alternative use of the land has yet been identified, other than leaving it uncultivated. Allow me to make some summary comments. The Commissioner has endeavoured to demonstrate that the Commission undertook thorough research. It should therefore be in a position to provide figures for the drop in tobacco consumption in the Union following reform. It should also be able to provide information on the tariffs to be imposed in order to restrict imports of tobacco into the Union. I trust the Commission took careful note of events in the House this morning during the vote on the budget. Parliament rejected Amendments Nos 723 and 338. The amendments would have resulted in drastic reductions of tobacco premiums. Once again, Parliament has demonstrated its understanding of the social damage a cut in premiums would inflict on so many rural European families. I must reiterate that there is nothing else they can grow. I know the Commissioner for Agriculture has feelings. I would like to hope he has taken this political message on board.
costep_2006-06-01_1_109	It is always appropriate to highlight the responsibility that falls to the law, to the Member States and to the Union to attach priority to promoting children’s rights, and especially so today, which is World Children’s Day. Children are our future and make up around one fifth of the population of the EU. I support the creation of this Framework Decision on the recognition and enforcement in the EU of prohibitions arising from convictions for sexual offences committed against children, and the amendments tabled by the rapporteur. This is a crucial step towards improving cooperation between the Member States in protecting children. Furthermore it has a twofold purpose: to improve access to information on prohibitions, through compulsory registration of prohibition in the criminal record; and to make it compulsory to enforce them. It will accordingly be possible to stop a person who has been convicted of paedophilia in one Member State, and has been banned from any activity involving contact with children, from sidestepping that ban by moving to another Member State. A disqualification of this nature handed down in one Member State will have a legal effect in the other Member States, thereby broadening the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of disqualifications and prohibitions.
costep_2010-12-13_15_29	Mr President, despite the austerity budgets, despite the International Monetary Fund, despite the Stabilisation Fund, and despite a penalty-based mechanism for economic coordination, the attack on the euro continues through the speculative attack on the sovereign debts of several countries. It must be acknowledged that the error can only be in the political decisions that have been taken. Every time that Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy speculate in public, the speculators immediately thank them and speculate accordingly. It is clear that every time that they say 'no' to Eurobonds in particular, the speculators thank them because they are grateful for the price; the price of this speculation is division in Europe. This is a Europe without solidarity and a Europe in which the peripheral countries are becoming increasingly peripheral. This must change, Mr President.
costep_1999-12-15_6_46	We must draw the right lessons from the lack of results at the Seattle Ministerial Summit, which was supposed to fix the agenda for the Millennium Round at the World Trade Organisation. The failure of the negotiations, which we see as something positive, is not simply the result of chance events that were more or less forced by circumstance. In good time, we stated the need to provide a balance sheet of the effects of the Uruguay Round. We even suggested a moratorium on the start of negotiations with a view to being able to produce this kind of balance sheet and to produce a subsequent study of the routes that international trade relations are taking. We were thinking about the obscurity of the methods that have been followed. The negative consequences for the world’s poorest countries were - and are - particularly obvious. We were aware of their concerns and finally, the reason behind them. We were also aware of the growing concern among world public opinion in general about a form of globalisation that creates inequalities and injustices because it is fundamentally determined by the rules of the market and consequently by the interests that control it. Today, as we are aware of the failure to which I referred, the study, which we have previously suggested, becomes even more imperative, before any negotiations are restarted. The WTO must be reformed from top to toe. It has become crucial to move towards a limitation in the power of its rules. It is crucial that we build a serious and deep alliance with developing countries, an alliance that respects their right to economic and social progress. It is also becoming inevitable then to envisage a new trade order - in the context of a globalisation based on progress and solidarity - which respects fundamental political rights, social progress and the environment.
costep_2000-10-25_5_3	Mr President, we have never before spoken with so many people and such little attention in the House. The large-scale production and use of anti-personnel landmines is an appalling phenomenon, not only due to its consequences, but also because it demonstrates worrying cruelty, perversity, hypocrisy and the paradoxical dehumanisation of a good number of those with responsibility for humaneness and for ensuring its progress. The figures in the reports by Mrs Bonino and Mrs Morgantini are frightening and, while reading them, many of us reacted with a deep feeling of shame as people dedicated to politics, and with cynical pessimism with regard to the human condition itself. We are talking about millions of people killed or maimed, between 70 and 100 million mines that could explode at any time, anywhere in 60 countries. The reports give less emphasis to the fact that the majority of those mines were manufactured outside the countries in which they are buried. Nor is emphasis given to the fact that the list of countries most seriously affected mainly comprises developing countries. Fortunately, emphasis is placed, however, on the fact that the mines constitute a fundamental obstacle to the development of these regions in addition to a lethal threat of death and distress. Interruption by the President to request silence Courage is needed in the face of the reality with which Mrs Bonino and Mrs Morgantini present us if we are not to fall victim to despair. Fortunately, their reports also include a long list of the actions currently under way to put an end to the folly of anti-personnel mines, to oppose their production and proliferation, to eliminate them, to compensate the damage caused by those that have already fulfilled their cruel purpose, to clear and free from their effects territories so unjustly maltreated. And here, as in other contexts, the actions of the European Union and Parliament itself give reason for confidence, for reconciliation with our own kind, as with this step forward, this Commission regulation that we are trying to improve in this parliamentary procedure, reaffirming our commitment and our hope. This perspective will guide our amendments and our votes. Our efforts over all these years have been to this end, including in 1998 when the North-South Centre of the Council of Europe, over which I have the honour of presiding, awarded its annual prize to Mr Axworthy, Minister for Foreign Affairs in Canada, for the efforts of his government which took concrete form in the Ottawa Convention. Mrs Bonino, of course, received this same prize in 1999 and her report today is further proof that those of us who supported her candidature were right to do so.
costep_2011-05-11_6_149	In January 2009, the Commission adopted the proposal for a new regulation on textile names and related labelling of textile products. The aim of the proposal is to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products with a view to encouraging the development and uptake of new fibres. By transforming the three existing directives into a single regulation, the proposal facilitates the process to adapt legislation to technical progress whilst allowing fibre users to benefit more readily from innovative products on the market. I welcome this proposal, and I consider it particularly significant that the new regulation contains a specific reference to 'Made in' labelling. It is crucial, in fact, to continue along this path in order to furnish the European Union with the tools to compete with and face its main trade partners, such as the United States, Canada, China and Japan, on the globalised market. Furthermore I wish to emphasise here what is, in my view, the most important aspect of the agreement reached with the Council, namely, the commitment by the European Commission to present, by 30 September 2013, after it has carried out a suitable impact assessment, a report accompanied by legislative proposals regarding indication of origin labelling, traceability and the use of new technologies.
costep_2002-01-16_17_9	Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, ladies and gentlemen, the new agreement on cooperation and development, the Cotonou Agreement, constitutes a significantly improved framework for cooperation with the ACP States. It is an agreement that we emphatically support, one in which the significant improvements in terms of content and policy originated in proposals by Parliament. We do not, therefore, share either the rapporteur’s highly critical assessment or his reasons for it. Indeed, we take the view that it is something of a caricature. Let me, in response to the rapporteur’s analysis, list three points in favour. Firstly, the establishment of a parliamentary assembly represents genuine progress, in that, after an appropriate preparatory period, ACP States will be represented only by freely elected parliamentarians, rather than by ambassadors, as is still to some extent the case. This principle must not only be incorporated into the new rules of procedure of our Joint Assembly, but also put into practice. We will vote against the admittance of any ACP ambassador if, for example, he displaces freely elected African delegates. The second is the regional approach to cooperation, also originating in proposals by this Parliament, which puts an end to economic parochialism in Africa. Our cooperative effort must in future be focused on regional free trade and cooperation agreements. We insist that our regional parliamentary cooperation should begin on the ground this very year, for example subsequent to our Southern African meeting in Cape Town in March or our meeting with ECOWAS in the course of the year. Thirdly, we support the reinforcement of the clause on democracy and human rights, which we believe must be speedily implemented. Let me mention only Nigeria, Togo and Zimbabwe as examples of why this is so. We hope that this will bring about genuine parliamentary partnership with our fellow parliamentarians in Africa and elsewhere in the ACP countries.
costep_2011-01-19_7_204	I voted in favour of the joint resolution on international adoption, because I strongly believe that European coordination of adoption strategies and tools would not only bring about an improvement in the procedure as such, but would also ensure greater protection for orphans and abandoned children and their right to have a family. Synergy between international organisations, EU institutions and Member States would lead to a virtuous circle in which the central focus of children’s needs would be flanked by the guarantee of information, preparation and support services for adoptive families. Finally, I believe that improved coordination can ensure greater certainty for adoptees in terms of correct adoption procedures and mutual recognition of documents, thus preventing child trafficking.
costep_2004-12-13_1_135	Mr President, I would firstly like to thank my colleague, Mr Eurlings, for his excellent report, which takes account of different points of view. Although I myself am more critical of Turkey’s accelerated accession, I nevertheless lend my strong support to adopting Mr Eurlings’s report. What amazes me most about Turkey’s membership is the great haste in which it is being pursued. Many experts predict that the political strength to say no to Turkey will not be found anywhere in ten years’ time, even if she did not meet the conditions of membership. This haste could prove to be a big mistake. In Turkey’s case, we cannot turn a blind eye to the matter of human rights. The conditions relating to human rights and those of minorities must be fully met before membership can be approved. I myself am also worried by how much Turkey’s membership will cost, and the fact that nobody seems to know this. External estimates suggest quite enormous sums of money. The contributions by the current net contributors would grow substantially. This in turn could increase public dissatisfaction with the EU. After Turkey has joined, the Union will no longer be the same EU as it is now. For that reason, our citizens should have the right to express their own opinions about the issue. We should encourage the Member States to organise referenda on it. I fear that Turkey’s accelerated accession is too big a mouthful to swallow, and that the EU is likely to choke on it.
costep_2007-09-24_16_29	I congratulate Mrs Thomsen on her excellent report. I agree with my fellow Members, and in particular with my colleague Mr Paasilinna, that we cannot be doctrinaire in matters relating to energy and that we must not think of renewable energy as a panacea in itself. It will not solve Europe’s problems on its own, but it is a very important step in the right direction. In this regard we are all in agreement, and this point is masterfully underlined in Mrs Thomsen’s report. At the same time, however, several Members have made the point that technological progress is needed, because the new Members States and poorer Member States in particular perceive the use of solar power, wind power or - in the case of my country, where thermal springs abound - geothermal energy, to be extremely expensive. I would ask Commissioner Piebalgs to urge the Commission to consider carefully how these technologies might be stimulated in Europe, perhaps also by means of tenders. I do not mean simple technologies of the kind my fellow MEPs and I saw recently in Tibet when we were told that households were equipped with solar power. We were reluctant to believe it, but it later transpired that they were referring to a very simple little plate capable of heating a jug of water in half an hour. I am thinking of altogether more serious technologies. As regards the agricultural sector, biofuels are very important, and I agree with Mrs Myller that we must not create a situation that pits biofuel production against the food industry and food production. Let us also be sensible about bioethanol production, because sometimes producing bioethanol consumes more fossil fuel than it enables us to save. I believe, therefore, that we need to take a diversified approach on this issue.
costep_2010-12-16_7_75	Nine years after the start of the military intervention in Afghanistan, it is possibly the greatest challenge faced by Europe and its allies in terms of foreign intervention and global security. The truth is that in the last decade, despite the strong - and uninterrupted - international presence in Afghanistan, security in the country has deteriorated. Terrorists continue to be supported and trained and, on top of this, the main socio-economic indicators are unsatisfactory. At present, therefore, the main objective of the international community and of Europe should be to encourage the creation of a strong and stable government, so the peace process continues to be supported, insofar as it respects the three basic commitments listed in the report: (i) Afghanistan’s commitment to banishing al-Qaeda from the country; (ii) eradicating poppy cultivation and combating drug trafficking; and (iii) a willingness to establish a basic respect for fundamental human rights. Within this framework, and in accordance with the international commitments that have been made in the context of NATO, the military presence in Afghanistan should be progressively reduced, while maintaining international support for peacekeeping and security with a view to post-intervention stability.
costep_1998-09-17_5_26	SMEs represent an ever growing percentage of Europe’s fabric of production, particularly in less developed European regions. Therefore all moves or initiatives in support of small businesses promote Europe’s economic growth in general and are certain to help in achieving regional economic cohesion. I therefore welcome the Commission’s interest in initiatives to open up European capital markets for small and medium-sized enterprises, and I fully agree with the rapporteur, Mr Hendrick, about the need to carry out information campaigns for individuals and organisations so as to encourage greater investment in SMEs, funding their expansion and development. I also back Mr Scarbonchi’s view that it is necessary to improve European programmes and initiatives to promote SMEs: those concentrated in rural areas above all owe their survival and future potential to better coordination between industry, agriculture and tourism. Finally, I can endorse the thrust of the Commission’s proposed directive establishing a fair payment term for the settlement of sales invoices: cash-flow difficulties and liquidity crises are in fact among the main reasons for bankruptcy among SMEs.

costep_2001-09-04_6_12	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the positive outcomes of the Treaty of Nice is the European Company and we are now debating this in the context of Mr Menrad’s report on the involvement of employees, which I welcome. My concern is simply that if we constantly extend workers' rights and in particular if we lower thresholds, as is the case in this report - from 1000 employees to 500 for the rules on worker participation to be applied - we will place too great a burden on this European Company. The European Company is supposed to attract companies to Europe. This new company model is intended to open up Europe as a business location and make it more attractive. That is why it is also necessary, in particular where worker participation is concerned, for us to keep a sense of proportion and not to burden the companies adopting this model with these new rights in such a way that it is simply no longer of interest to those who wish either to enter Europe or to use the European Company to be more mobile within the European single market. In my view sufficient account has not been taken of this and that is why I have voted against.
costep_1999-09-14_5_35	Madam President, Mr President-designate of the Commission, I am also among those who tomorrow will vote noif something decisive still does not happen. And make no mistake, the discussion in the PPE Group this evening will still be very exciting. These are the reasons why I shall be voting noif no far-reaching change is to take place. Firstly, your Commission reveals a democratic deficit, Mr Prodi. The result of the European election is not reflected at any point in your team. I can appreciate why you ve accepted a green"" Commissioner in view of the result achieved by the Greens in the European election. People will not, however, understand why ten Socialists are to be represented when they ask what influence their votes have really had upon the composition of the European Commission. And let us ask your predecessor, Mr Santer. Who, in this connection, has achieved any kind of success with the various national governments? My second reason is the answers given by the Commissioners-designate at the hearings about the van Buitenen case. The citizens of Europe will not understand it if a new strategy is not at last applied here and those who care about transparency do not also finally receive stronger support in the Commission. The biggest problem for me and many others, however, is the proposed successor to Mrs Cresson. I do not, of course, want to pronounce any legal judgement upon Mr Busquin. I do not represent Belgian justice, and none of us want to put him in prison. The question is that of how we can restore trust in the European institutions. Do you really believe that we can win the citizens' trust when the only answer we are ever presented with is I have not been accused personally? Mr Busquin is involved in the Inusop affair and has not been accused for the sole reason that the case became statute-barred. This is an astonishing parallel to the case of the EU’s Balkans Co-ordinator, Bodo Hombach. And in the Dessault-Augusta affair it has since become very clear that he knew of an illicit fund. I wonder who can guarantee us that we will not have illicit funds in the Commission in future, in the DG XII or elsewhere, if this subject is not tackled in a better way than has so far been the case. So, Mr Prodi, you can still convince me by active intervention, but you must provide a very clear sign to Parliament and to the public. Otherwise, I shall be voting notomorrow like a lot of other people. It won t be a no"" vote for Europe but a vote for a clean, democratic and transparent Europe.
costep_2000-09-20_2_15	Madam President, I would just like to return to the problems associated with the constituency weeks. What I find very strange is not so much the payments, but the fact that a constituency week has been scheduled just before spring half-term in certain Member States or just before carnival week in a number of other Member States when people are off work on the Monday and Tuesday. In opting for a constituency week at this stage, you ought to have made it coincide with carnival week instead of the week prior to it. I would ask the Bureau to reconsider this.
costep_2000-07-06_10_13	Madam President, I think that Mrs Maij-Weggen is quite right to call the situation catastrophic. It is, in fact, a complex situation, in which many people have died. The question that arises is why communities that had been co-existing relatively peacefully should suddenly shift to this level of tension and threats. I think that certain forces are at work behind these actions, and there is a significant similarity between a certain type of behaviour that we are now seeing in the Moluccas and the events we recently witnessed in East Timor. Behind these actions are forces that wish to sabotage President Wahid’s efforts at democratisation. We need to understand these forces and to combat them. From this point of view, I think that the references in the compromise motion for a resolution, which deserves our total support, are most timely. Death penalty in the United States
costep_2010-10-07_13_54	I am abstaining out of consideration for the Danish workers of the Linak Group who have been sacrificed on the altar of globalisation. In the situation into which they are plunged as a result of the neoliberal policies advocated by the European Union, one could be inclined to vote against, given the pitiful amount of this handout. However, the little that is being given may help to ease their pain. This does not make the rationale of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund any less intolerable. It endorses the rationale that brings a leading international company such as Linak to relocate with the aim of increasing its profits, the amount of which it does not even have the decency to disclose.
costep_2002-12-05_4_59	Mr President, I would like to move, on behalf my group, in accordance with Rule 37(4) of the Rules of Procedure, that this House should decide whether the joint motion for a resolution tabled by the PPE-DE and PSE groups should be put to the vote before the other resolutions. My justification for this is as follows. On 14 November we submitted a motion for a resolution to the administration. I have here the electronic record confirming its transmission. Therefore our original motion has priority. In accordance with Rule 37(4) of the Rules of Procedure, a subsequently tabled joint motion for a resolution replaces the original motion. That means that the subsequently tabled joint motion is regarded as that submitted first and should be put to the vote first. In the event that the House does not follow this procedure, I wish to ask the President to pronounce that the amendments tabled by the Liberals, the Greens and the Communists are inadmissible in accordance with Article 140(4) of the Rules of Procedure, which stipulates that only amendments that have not already been tabled once may be tabled. As the content of the joint motion for a resolution tabled by these groups is exactly the same as those amendments, only one of the two can be admissible. It does not make sense for us to follow the voting list, because we would then have to vote on the same content twice. That is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the Rules of Procedure. Applause
costep_2009-03-23_16_8	Mr President, due to the specific nature of this legislation, and potential danger of any incorrect interpretation of it, we should pay particular attention to the issue of biocidal agents. I agree with the rapporteur, who spoke about the fact that it is vital to extend the transitional period, for assessing active substances used in biocidal products, until 2014, in order to use EU legislation to regulate the market. If we were not to take this step, would the national provisions - which expire in 2010 - result in the sale of a significant number of biocidal products becoming illegal, which would lead to a variety of paradoxical situations? During the transitional period, national legislation should be used to monitor strictly this specific section of the market. It is worth adding here that we should be particularly careful when dealing with any legislation concerning biocidal agents, and remember that these products are intended to destroy and repel harmful organisms and that they contain active chemical agents. Any carelessness on our part may have irrevocable consequences.
costep_2002-10-22_2_91	Mr President, we would like to add three comments concerning the Budget at this reading. First of all, at the Commission’s proposal, Parliament decided to set up a Solidarity Fund within the budget lines B2-400 and B7-090 during the previous sitting. I expressed our doubts surrounding this fund at the time, and I shall now confine myself to the budgetary aspects. This fund is, to all intents and purposes, virtual, for it is still empty. When a major disaster does strike, we will need to find resources in the Budget for this Fund retrospectively. This strikes us as highly improbable. Furthermore, if more than one disaster strikes in any one calendar year, the Fund’s upper limit (EUR 1 billion) may also create a problem. Imagine that a major disaster strikes in the spring, to which the Commission assigns EUR 700 million from this Fund. What would happen if another disaster on a similar scale were to strike in the autumn? There is the risk that the resources allocated for the following year would be released prematurely. This could be the thin end of the wedge. Given the uncertain origin of the Fund’s resources, we are faced with the undesirable situation whereby there is a Fund for which no provisions have been made in the 2003 Budget. This means that after a number of years, considerable pressure could be brought to bear on the Member States to make additional contributions. Given the current economic situation and the freedom in budgetary policy that some Member States allow themselves, I can foresee major problems. I should now like to make a critical comment on the Budget for the Sixth Framework Programme on research and development. The funding of research from the EU budget brings with it ethical dilemmas, as is the case, for example, in research on embryos. In the fanatical fight to fund research of this kind, the entire framework programme will soon be in the balance because at second reading Parliament refused to make any more guideline statements about the funding of controversial areas. Moreover, the Council would have been better to start the debate on ethics sooner and postpone the ethical guidelines until after the programme had been accepted. This controversy demonstrates that the framework programme should have been restricted to facilitating cross-border cooperation. Active financial support is undesirable and superfluous. Why should we co-finance research that is likely to take place anyway? My third and final comment concerns fisheries. The Commission and Parliament devote much attention to the Spanish and Portuguese fishermen who, together with their regions, are let down by the lack of an agreement with Morocco. Millions of euros have been spent on compensation, reducing the numbers of fishermen and re-training them in those regions. Other fishing regions are also starting to feel the pinch now. Apparently, biologists are now advising the Commission to ban cod fishing and to reduce other quotas. This would have a major financial impact in the Netherlands, among others. Would it not make sense, therefore, to shift the budget’s attention to fishing regions that have been self-sufficient to date? Financial support for those regions in the form of socio-economic programmes is desirable. This aspect, however, is still missing from this budget which spends millions on fisheries agreements with third countries, from which only a minority of countries and shipowners benefit. Speaking of solidarity, it would not hurt for the EU to devote more attention financially to a fishing industry that has not been able to make use of subsidies for the renovation and building of ships for years. This has caused unfair competition for many years. A fisheries sector that keeps to the quotas should be able to expect more from Brussels.
costep_1999-03-09_8_17	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us concerns limiting the exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields 0 Hz - 300 GHz, which is the entire spectrum of possible effects. This is no doubt a good approach, but it does not allow for detailed rules at European level so that in my view the subsidiarity principle should be applied in some areas. Overall, it is to be welcomed that the Committee on the Environment did not accept the doubtless well-intentioned proposals from the rapporteur, on the grounds I referred to above. But well-intentioned does not always mean good. Moreover, the rapporteur’s proposals could not be justified scientifically - as many speakers have mentioned today - and would in practice have led to low limits that could not have been adhered to. Or should we go so far as to get rid of mobile phones and emergency telephones? I do not think that can do us much good. Let me raise another point. The discussion between experts has shown that laying down safety distances from fixed installations, for example high-voltage transmission lines, is of extremely questionable use in protecting against radiation because, apart from the distance as such, numerous parameters specific to the installation can have quite a determining effect on exposure. In the case of electrical devices, laying down minimum safety distances is even more of a problem. As a rule the distance between such devices and the public is surely determined by whether they are used as they should be. In this case I think it is confusing, unhelpful and inconsistent with the aims of adequate protection against radiation to lay down additional safety distances. The situation is different in the case of equipment that is designed to produce fields, such as broadcasting transmitters. Here, safety distances can no doubt simplify matters. I would ask you to consider this at the vote. I have tabled the corresponding amendments.
costep_1997-06-25_12_6	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too must congratulate Mr Wiersma on his excellent report. This report could not be more clear. I therefore hope that the Commission - although Mr Van den Broek is not here to represent it - will take note of all the criticisms it contains. For how can we judge whether or not European funds are being efficiently spent if there are no criteria by which they can be tested? I was recently with a delegation in the Czech Republic where I was asked whether the PHARE programme was primarily an employment scheme for Western consultants. The PHARE programme has slowly changed and grown from a programme for technical assistance into a programme to support the accession of Central and Eastern European countries. What does this mean for PHARE and future priorities? First of all, it must mean improved infrastructure in these countries in the fields of transport, telecommunications, energy, know-how, and also - as Mrs Van Bladel has already said - in the banking sector, which is very important. In fact, investment is not possible without it. A second point is to reinforce the legal and institutional framework and assistance in areas where the Union is placing greater emphasis, such as free competition, the environment, nuclear safety and a favourable climate for small and medium-sized enterprises. This brings other demands for project support, both from the Commission and from the local authorities in Central and Eastern Europe. The Commission must make its procedures simpler and more transparent. But the Eastern European authorities must also be quicker to reform their institutions and reduce bureaucracy so that there is no more under-spending. However, Western governments cannot meet Eastern Europe’s major financial needs on their own. There is a also a need for much private financing. The banks are ready for this. There is a proposal for a new Marshall Plan and that must primarily come from the private banking sector. These private investors must be attracted and this requires a stimulating regulatory framework in these countries, combined with stability. The European Union can actively contribute to this through the PHARE programme. Conditions can be imposed on these countries which can also serve to increase financing from the private sector.
costep_2000-10-24_5_29	Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, as you know, my Group has unanimously decided to table a motion rejecting the draft budget for the year 2001. This is a truly extraordinary initiative, especially at first reading, and one that is bound to be unsuccessful, for in the present circumstances it cannot possible gain a majority of votes in favour. We knew as much when we took the decision, so why did we take it? Every man and every woman here needs to realise that unless we challenge the ultra-restrictive strategy that characterises the Council’s draft budget then, come 2001, we are going to find ourselves in a situation where we are not able to honour all our commitments to our partners in the Balkans, the southern Mediterranean and other developing regions of the world. We are going to be in some way forced to choose between these three priorities, even though they are identically legitimate and equally urgent, and this is not, in our view, acceptable. The Council’s decision to cut a quarter of the appropriations earmarked for the Balkans, even before the change in the situation in Serbia, to cut EUR 150 million of the appropriations intended for Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and more generally to cut all appropriations for cooperation with the South is taking us directly down this blind alley. How is it possible to formally receive President Kostunica at the European Council in Biarritz, to convene an extraordinary Council in Marseilles devoted to Euro-Mediterranean partnership and to make an urbi et orbi proclamation of the most noble aspirations, raising encouraging hopes among the people of Eastern Europe and the south of Europe, without, at the same time, providing ourselves with the means to fulfil these commitments? The budget is not the be all and end all, of course, but it does reflect the political will of the fifteen Member States. For all that, the same approach has been applied to the European Union’s internal policies. Jacques Chirac spoke lyrically, in this very Chamber, of the Europe of all citizens, male and female, yet the draft budget of the Fifteen envisages an absolute reduction in appropriations in chapters as important as social action, employment, education, training, youth, culture, audiovisual media and the environment. On some of these lines, even the amendments from the Committee on Budgets, although positive, fall short of the 2000 budget. This is true for employment, the environment and trans-European networks, and, as we have seen, the problem is even more critical as regards external actions. We must not allow ourselves to fall into this trap. The only way to get out of it is to demand that the financial perspective be reviewed, particularly Chapter 4. The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has done so, and the President of the European Parliament clearly expressed the same views in Biarritz. Mrs Haug, the general rapporteur also attempted, last night, to amend her report in this respect in order to reflect the concerns expressed by my Group, and I must thank her for that. Had this amendment been adopted in its initial version, it might have started to deal the cards afresh, but the idea was rejected by the majority of the Committee on Budgets. So is the European Parliament therefore about to implicitly accept the Council’s position, no matter what it says? This is a blind alley, which my Group is not ready to go down. In this connection, I should like to refer to a crucial passage in the speech by the general rapporteur. Earlier, Mrs Haug quite rightly pointed out that the Council has refused to discuss a multiannual revision of the financial perspective and to continue like this, as she said, is completely unacceptable. So, what conclusions must we logically draw from this situation? Our motion to reject the Council text is specifically aimed at contributing towards highlighting, in good time, this key political problem on which, sooner or later, we shall have to deliver an opinion in order, in the long term, to match European projects with the resources needed to implement them.
costep_2007-05-09_17_6	Madam President, Mr Verheugen, Mr Lütke Daldrup, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to congratulate our rapporteur and also to thank him because Mr Toubon has worked in a spirit of complete cooperation with all his colleagues. Consequently, we have always been informed of his positions and of the progress of the dossier after every discussion with the Commission and the Presidency of the Council. Mr Toubon has sought our opinion, providing us in good time with clear, precise notes, which have enabled us to make up our minds with full knowledge of the facts. At the time of the vote at first reading, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe took a stand against maintaining packaging sizes insofar as these mandatory categories did not exist in the 27 Member States and these obligations could hamper innovation and competition by limiting consumer choice. The ALDE Group has, however, come round to the Council common position and supports the idea of transitional periods for certain categories of product. On the other hand, the ALDE Group did not necessarily want a revision clause to be entered into the actual body of the directive, as it felt that the reference to this review clause in a recital sufficed. Recognising, however, the persuasive powers of the rapporteur, the ALDE Group will support him on this point as, I might add, it will support his amendments as a whole. Aside from this vote, however, may I express my regret that none of the institutions has taken up the idea of concordance tables, which appeared in Article 8 of the basic proposal. In accordance with the 'Better lawmaking' interinstitutional agreement, the Member States are in fact encouraged to establish for themselves and in the Community interest their own concordance tables between the directives and the transitional measures and, above all, to make them public. This point is particularly important for the ALDE Group, which is very committed to improving information for consumers and, beyond that, which is fighting for better information for European citizens.
costep_2000-06-15_2_9	Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is no cliché to say that, on the eve of the European Council in Feira, this is a decisive moment for the European Union. The proof of this is the fact that in recent months there have been an increasing number of declarations, beginning with Heads of State such as President Campi of Italy, President Rau of Germany, prominent European politicians such as Helmut Schmidt, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, Jacques Delors and more recently, with great success, the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Fischer, all of whom have related the debate on the Intergovernmental Conference with a debate which is of importance to all of us, that is, 'where is Europe heading?' . I think that this is healthy given that we are on the threshold of the greatest and most ambitious enlargement the European Union has ever known. This debate reflects the political will of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and also Parliament as a whole, who wish to achieve an ambitious agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference. Since we have been talking about photographic technology, to use a cinematic analogy, I would say that we need to be involved in the writing of the script, we need a good ending, and we MEPs must not be cast as extras, but as lead actors. With regard to the Intergovernmental Conference, it is important that President Herzog appears before the European Council in Feira. I would like to point out that, when we talk about the community of values, - and there have been recent opportunities to do so, such as the formation of the new Austrian Government - we must demand that the Charter of Fundamental Rights be clearly included in the Treaty in order to fulfil the purpose of Articles 6 and 7 of that Treaty. Furthermore, although the Treaty of the European Union recognises European citizenship, until now, economic and social, individual and collective rights have not been developed. It is completely contradictory to have citizenship without rights. It is therefore absolutely essential that the Charter of Fundamental Rights be incorporated into the Treaty. In this process, the status of political parties is a means for them also to be protagonists on the European stage. With regard to the convention, I would add one more element, and that is that, in the drawing up of the Charter, the convention is turning out to be a more transparent, democratic and open formula than the classic procedure of the Intergovernmental Conferences. It is a formula for the future and I believe we should take it very seriously. In this regard, I will add two decisive points. One is, for Parliament, that decisions made by qualified majority should be accompanied by the codecision procedure, and the second point is that we must favour integration over closer cooperation, because what we are actually doing is integrating. In the economic field, what we need is greater coordination of economic, social and employment policies. We must implement the conclusions of the European Council in Lisbon, which are positive and have achieved a broad consensus in this Parliament as well, but this requires that we increase our capacity for economic government. If we wish to create employment, if we wish to defend and fulfil the social agenda at a time when the European train is beginning to move faster and needs more steam, the last thing we need is for our work to be hindered by a strictly monetarist management with no economic counterbalance. That is an absolutely decisive point for the coming months. Lastly, Madam President, I would like to make a very brief comment: the report on the progress made with regard to enlargement has been important because it indicates how the problems are being overcome and how we have to maintain this will with the countries with whom we are negotiating. I believe that it is also important for the Commission, with regard to the Balkans, to take account of the fact that there is a country which could become a bridge - having before been a barrier - towards the Balkans, and that is Croatia. After the political change which has taken place, the Commission should intensify the negotiation of the association agreement with Croatia. Finally, I would like to say a few words about the Middle East. I have just returned from a visit to Syria and Lebanon and I welcome the fact that the President of the Commission is there at the moment. I agree that the Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon is very important and we must support Barak, but we should also intensify our partnership with Syria and Lebanon. We must have an active policy in order to contribute towards resolving the dramatic problem of the Palestinian refugees, and we can actively offer ideas and resources in order to ensure that the Middle East peace process will make decisive progress, which would also lead to a greater opening up and intensification of the Euro-Mediterranean process. All of these elements are on the agenda and I hope that the European Council in Feira will make progress.
costep_1998-11-18_12_48	Mr President, there have been few times when the various rapporteurs and draftsmen in a committee have worked so much in unison as we have done in the Committee on Fisheries on the reform of the Structural Funds. We were trying to prevent structural actions in the fisheries sector from being left practically to the Commission’s discretion and to neutralise the contradictions and the enormous programming problems that the current proposal presents. Therefore, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries on the framework regulation, I have proposed the creation of a single legal instrument that would enable us to draw up a regulation on fisheries Structural Funds - the FIFG - which, being horizontal in nature, might bring together all the structural actions involving the fisheries sector, as the Commission itself has already done for the agricultural sector. This need for a single sectorial legal instrument was easily understood by the various parliamentary committees and the change proposed will - I hope - be incorporated at this first reading. The fisheries sector does, in fact, need to have access to a series of structural measures that must be the same for the entire sector, regardless of the region in which a particular fisheries enterprise is established. That is why the legal instrument that embraces them needs to be of a horizontal nature. This essential horizontal nature is destroyed by the regional planning that the Commission’s proposal establishes for Objective 2 regions. The result of this will be enormous programming difficulties in the fisheries sector and serious risks of relocation of enterprises, as they will establish themselves in those regions where there are regional programmes or where the regional programmes are more favourable to them. It was therefore necessary to correct this tendency so that the Member States might have the flexibility needed to establish the most appropriate level of programming for the fisheries sector, regardless of the region concerned. Commissioner, you have seen that many Members have spoken on the subject of fisheries. The structural side of the fisheries sector is greatly affected The President cut the speaker off
costep_1999-10-29_4_6	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Cunha, on the report which he has carried out. I would like first of all to express my support for the Agreement and for the position held by the European Commission, as well as the opinion expressed by Mrs Langenhagen, Mrs Fraga and Mr Medina. And I absolutely and radically disagree with the position of the previous speaker who has demonstrated a policy which shows very little solidarity with the Member States of the European Union and the fishermen. This policy fortunately has minority support in this Parliament. With regard to this report, I would like to point out that the fisheries agreement with Angola means a continuation of the common fisheries policy of the European Union with regard to international fisheries agreements, which contribute to the consolidation of one of the fundamental pillars of said policy. This was pointed out by Mr Crampton’s report to this Parliament in the previous legislature, this report stating that these agreements were a fundamental condition in the effort to reduce the commercial deficit in the European Union in the field of fishing, in fish supply and in order to protect direct and indirect employment in the fishing sector and in the industries related to fishing in the European regions which are heavily dependent on it. This was approved here during the last legislature. In relation to the Cunha report on the conclusion of a new Protocol which defines the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the agreement with the Republic of Angola for the period from 3 May 1999 to 2 May 2000, I would like to point out that this is a classic Protocol, which allows for access to fishing resources during a certain period and sets a financial contribution. Despite the fact that certain information and statistics must be borne in mind, and the Commission has promised to be very strict about this, and also bearing in mind the delicate situation that that country is in - it is in a state of war - we believe that the conclusion of this provisional Protocol is very positive, in the hope that it will be renewed for a year or that a new agreement will be reached. This is a very important country geopolitically, with a very considerable potential wealth and which the European Union has to support, clearly helping it to put an end to the serious situation which it is in. But it must help in the best way possible for both parties: Angola, on the one hand, and the Member States of the European Union and the regions involved in fishing, on the other, with the control of this Parliament and in accordance with the amendments which the Committee on Fisheries has presented with regard to this important Agreement which has, as has just been pointed out here, a considerable political dimension, as well as economic and financial dimensions. Therefore, Commissioner, on this question and with regard to fisheries agreements in general, as was demonstrated yesterday in the important debate which we held in relation to the fisheries agreement with Morocco, you will always enjoy the favourable, generally majority, opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, and I hope that you will continue to enjoy the favourable opinion of this Parliament.
costep_2008-06-16_18_30	Madam President, I speak now as a Member representing a country whose Parliament, supported by all the political parties, was second to ratify the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe and first to ratify the Lisbon Treaty. In this capacity I would like to remind you that the greatest danger in Europe today is national egoism, or nationalism. We must give some thought to whether we should be rewarding those who constantly demand more, or should we instead be sanctioning this kind of behaviour? Protecting national interests is a fundamental duty of every country’s government and its representatives in the European Parliament, but the European Union cannot function unless sober compromises are reached among the various national interests, and unless there is solidarity among its nations and peoples. I therefore strongly urge our Polish friends to lend their support, as the other twenty-six Member States have done, to establishing the European Institute of Innovation and Technology in Budapest. In the case of Frontex in Warsaw, Hungary too seemed to be in the running for a while, but did not use its veto. It would therefore be unfair if our Polish friends did not reciprocate with a similar gesture. Hungarian and Pole are two good friends; as the saying goes, 'Magyar and Pole, two friends so fine; together they fight and drink their wine'.
costep_1998-07-02_3_12	Mr President, the fact that we have many economic and social experiences and many ways to manage the related activities is typical of the European model of development and a source of wealth that must be protected. The report by Mrs Ghilardotti on the role of organizations and foundations in Europe rightly recalls the need to develop the entire third sector, the so-called non-profit sector. Today we are talking about foundations and NGOs, but soon we will have to talk about mutual societies and cooperatives. The Council must, however, move beyond the attitude that it has had up until now, which has been an attitude of objectively blocking the third sector. In Europe, there is not just the State and the private sector, but a wider range of experiences that cannot be ignored. We cannot talk about reform of the welfare state or innovation in international cooperation without the contribution of the private social work of the foundations and NGOs.
costep_2003-04-08_2_188	Commissioner, since the Erika accident on 19 December 1999, several initiatives have been taken by the European Parliament and the other European institutions to increase maritime safety. Unfortunately, the appropriate measures must not have been taken, because subsequently, in November 2002, we suffered a new maritime accident - involving the Prestige - and now we are revising what was approved at the first opportunity, resulting from the Erika disaster. To this end, we are currently also working in the European Parliament’s Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the reform of the Regulation on single-hull and double-hull oil tankers and there is a very important issue, which relates to the contribution. You have said that there is a European Union response centre, and I would like to know whether in it you have established emergency plans, above all for sensitive coastal areas, such as those of Galicia and Brittany, where year after year there are successive oil tanker accidents which cause damage to the environment.
costep_2000-05-17_12_2	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, deregulation in the telecommunications sector has continued for a decade and it has been a great success. The traditional telephone as we knew it is now a fading memory. In the past, people acquired a telephone in order to keep in touch with each other, but now they have become shareholders in a company, which could, for example, be acting as an intermediary in sexual services. I am sure this has come as a surprise to many. The instrument itself is so tiny that it could, for instance, be inadvertently placed in the mouth, being mistaken for false teeth; in this respect, too, things have changed a lot. Deregulation created fears of a fall in standards of public services and an increase in telephone charges. This has not happened, however, and instead services have become diversified and prices have fallen. Money to finance all this has, of course, been generated by new data terminal equipment, networks and services. The 1988 regulatory package was well timed and - due to its efficient implementation - worked well in several Member States. In some countries, however, implementation has been slow and even formal. We would support action by the Commission to improve cross-border services and honest competition. We are concerned at the fact that the limited supply of user access has prevented many user groups - in particular those with lower resources - from taking full advantage of, for instance, reasonably affordable Internet access. Therefore, we need new alternative loop systems, we must facilitate the development of wireless local loop systems and also, for instance, the use of a cable TV network, without having to resort to specific legislation on this issue, however. Parliament notes that due to the variations in its implementations, the current regime has led to legal uncertainty in different Member States. Sufficient transparency on the specific conditions for operating licences is required, so that undue delays in the approval process can be prevented. The most important reform strategy of the European Union is a reform initiative called eEurope, the framework of which was recently approved in Lisbon. The Commission must be congratulated on the fact that the structure and strategy of the European information society differ in a positive way from others in that it has not only taken account of competitiveness, but also of elements such as cohesion, social equality and employment. The objective is to prevent social discrimination and to increase consumer confidence and social cohesion. This initiative is impressively entitled: An Information Society For All. The radio spectrum is a scarce natural resource which has now started to come up for auction. We take a negative view of this with the exception of certain special instances. We were aware, as early as two years ago, that the GSM auction in the USA had resulted in a state of chaos, i.e. bankruptcies. Experiences from India are equally bad. Those in favour of auctioning believe it to be a good means of controlling resources. We think it will lead to increases in user tariffs and delays in the spreading and development of communications services. Prices at auction have now become incredibly high, and these will be passed on to the consumers, resulting in a new telecommunications tax. This would be an unfair tax, in that it would be the same for both rich and poor. Now that the eEurope initiative - with all its worthy objectives - has just been approved, it is being obstructed by the imposition of a new 'digital divide', a greedy fee-charging principle. In practice, this means that our priority project, the development of an information society, is now being obstructed through taxation. This is cause for concern, which, in my opinion, should be looked into in greater detail. I therefore request that the Commission investigate, without delay, the impact of this, the auctioning principle, in different countries, in order that we should have more information on which to base our opinion. Furthermore, this principle will privilege big operators, who will start dividing up the market. In the end, there will be the fear that as we reduce regulations, i.e. deregulate, these big operators will make mutual agreements and 'reregulate', creating new regulations. This cannot be right.
costep_2009-10-07_16_74	Mr President, I was also told I had three minutes, but I will try to stay within two minutes. I would like to join many of my fellow Members in expressing my satisfaction. I think that it is now time to put into effect, to implement the Treaty of Lisbon as soon as the ratifications take place, something which we hope will happen imminently. The committee which I chair has been doing everything in its power for some time now but, above all, it is important for Parliament to be aware of its new responsibilities: it must not allow the de facto loss of any aspect of its wider legislative functions. I would, however, like to highlight one issue which I do not think has been raised so far: there were many reasons why the Irish people previously rejected the Treaty, but one was the fear, among some voters, that the European legal system could violate, in Ireland. certain fundamental values concerning the right to life and the notion of family. These fears were allayed through declarations adopted by the European Councils of December 2008 and June 2009. I think this is important not just for Ireland, but for the whole of Europe. It was clarified, in fact, that the acquis communautaire does not concern the area relating to the right to life and the family. This clarification does not apply solely to Ireland, but to all the Member States. In reality, there was no need to clarify this because in various judgments involving France, the United Kingdom and Poland, the European Court of Human Rights had already ruled that in the areas of life, the value of life, respect for life and the family, it must be left up to the Member States to decide according to their history, tradition and culture. However, Ireland’s attention to detail had the merit of formally clarifying this point which, as I was saying, now applies to the entire European Union. I believe that this is a good thing, which makes holding the double referendum worthwhile. Naturally, we know full well that European culture consists of the sum of the cultures of all of the countries that make it up, and we all want Europe to be not just an economic area but also, and above all, a community of values. I therefore think it proper that we show Ireland both our satisfaction and our gratitude for everything that it offers Europe in terms of its history and its ideals. Europe needed Ireland, not only for technical reasons relating to its mechanisms and organisational structure, but also for Ireland’s contribution to what we are all seeking: the essence of Europe.
costep_1999-04-15_2_11	Mr President, Ombudsman, Commissioner, it seldom happens that the quality of a rapporteur’s work is quite so pleasing as the content of this report. The European Ombudsman’s annual report for 1998 shows that his institution has now become one of the best-functioning and most effective in the European Union. This applies particularly in terms of closeness to the people, which as we all know is one of the fundamental principles of the European Union. Mrs De Esteban Martín highlights this point so convincingly in her report that one can only hope it will be very widely read, particularly by those who would be responsible for fulfilling Professor Söderman’s requests for his office to have its own budget and for the change of status he has suggested, developments that would enable him to continue his work. Against the background of the Commission’s resignation, the call made by the Ombudsman for a code of good administrative practice to which citizens would have recourse is extremely topical. Foremost among the responsible parties I referred to is the European Parliament, since the European Ombudsman is commissioned by Parliament. One of the duties of the Committee on Petitions is to discharge that responsibility. How can it do that if it is not adequately equipped for its work? The Committee on Petitions has already approached the parliamentary administration on this point, although its plea did not elicit much of a response. Every Member of this House should look at the annexes to Mr Newman’s report in particular, which bring home the absurdity of the proposition that the work of the Committee on Petitions could be divided up among other committees. I am sorry to say that I must close by asking certain bodies in this House how they feel about the rights of their constituents when they seek to diminish the status of the basic right of petition by abolishing the Committee on Petitions, or when they try to change the name of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and call it the Committee on Legal Affairs and Consumers' Rights. The people of the Union are citizens first and foremost, then consumers, and any rights they have as consumers surely only exist by virtue of their civil rights. Allow me, Mr President, to thank Mr Newman, not only for his instructive and authoritative report but also for the work he has done in this important committee. I was only on that committee for a short time, but I was able to experience at first hand all those things for which my honourable colleagues have been expressing their gratitude. Thank you, Mr Newman.
costep_2002-04-25_4_46	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was not in Monterrey, but I often travel in the ACP countries in Africa, where it is forcefully brought home to visitors how poor countries groan under the burden of debt. The Cologne initiative on the remission of debt, though, can help alleviate this burden and inject new resources to bring about social benefits. That is the object of the Council resolution and the Commission communication on the implementation of the HIPC Initiative. Both of these are covered by the very balanced and excellent report which Mr Mantovani has presented, which sets out the new lines on which we, representing Europe, have to focus. This, though, will not alter or reform the international financial architecture, for which there is a compelling need, quite apart from the question of how much is available in terms of resources, for there must be a paradigm shift in development cooperation, especially with the poorest countries. That will not come about if we carry on as before; rather, we too are called upon to change our approach here too.
costep_2011-02-14_16_19	Mr President, as you are aware, in Romania, SMEs face more or less similar problems to those in other Member States, given the specific and difficult nature of the current period. However, there are aspects about improving the opportunities for SMEs to receive financial support which primarily derive from access to technical assistance aimed at accessing financial instruments, especially those devoted to increasing research and development capacity. I consider it necessary to increase access to good quality information and competent services. I should remind you that, during the plenary last September, the European Commission’s representative stated that in 2011, an online learning platform specifically for SMEs was scheduled to appear on the Internet. The aim of this is to facilitate SMEs' access to research and development projects and to utilise their results by providing free online training, personalised information and making a communication forum available. Training SME managers in how to use financial instruments may, apart from supporting the relevant procedures and cutting red tape, lead to achieving much more effective results.
costep_1998-03-30_9_4	Mr President, what is going on? In 1994, i.e. four years ago, the Commission presented a proposal which pays greater regard to road safety in general and the social legislation for long-distance drivers in particular, namely through the introduction of a new tachograph, because the current one is considered too easy to tamper with. Actually the matter is quite simple. All those affected, be it drivers, trade unions, haulage firms or the road users I interviewed, are in favour of an improvement. This improvement was presented to us by the Commission in its very sensible proposal of July 1994, but then Parliament wanted more. At first reading in the summer of 1995 Parliament did not just vote for a piece of equipment which is less easy to manipulate, but also for the development of a super black box involving an extensive infrastructure with the firms and inspection authorities. Global fleet management was to be a vision no longer. It was two years later - in 1997 - that the Council’s common position was presented to us. This is inadequate in many respects. I ask you and the Council how it can come about that, in the final analysis, the Council has only voted on the super black box and not simultaneously on the satisfactory, cost-effective, sound, feasible and acceptable solution proposed by Parliament. Who is hiding something here and why? When I first heard about the Council’s decision, I thought I was dreaming, and I still hope that this is all a mistake and that tomorrow this blunder will not be endorsed by Parliament as well. I am in favour of a modern, technologically assisted transport safety system, but each businessman should be able to decide for himself in this free market of ours, whether he wants a superbox or the equally attractive, so-called improved solution. The entrepreneur ultimately knows best what costs he and his business can sustain. If the common position of the Council becomes a reality tomorrow, then the previous tamper-prone tachograph and the new superbox, which still has not been clearly defined and examined for its legal force - the old and the new equipment therefore - will exist for ten years or more side by side. Neither have anything in common. On the contrary, an incentive will be given for a driver to transfer from the old vehicle to the new because he knows that the two types of recording equipment cannot be compared with each other and that he cannot be prosecuted for failing to observe the proper driving and rest periods. If the Council has voted 14: 1 against the more sensible solution, but in favour of the superbox, this means that there is no wish to achieve increased control and hence improved road safety. Or how do you see things, ladies and gentlemen? I hope that our vote tomorrow will not turn into a nightmare and that we will vote as at first reading, because I think like you, Mr Wijsenbeek, 1A and 1B are the correct solution.
costep_2002-11-21_4_30	Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with what Mr Monti said in a recent interview, namely that the considerable gap between growth and unemployment rates, which puts Europe at a disadvantage compared with the United States, is caused to a large extent by economic structures in this continent which continue to be much less open to competition. In my view, a competitive economy open to competition would bring tangible social benefits in the European countries. The Commissioner thus concluded that we need an even more vigorous competition policy than that in the United States, and we should give him credit for having pursued it, even accepting the risk of making mistakes or in any case, making judgments different from those made by judicial bodies called upon in some cases to decide. With regard to state aid, in particular, Europe is set to face an extremely important challenge over the next few years in the current negative economic climate. Efforts to recover state aid are being made alongside protectionism and state intervention in the economy: a perilous path to take. The Treaties wisely set strict limits on state aid and these limits must be preserved and confirmed, not least where governments seek to misuse or liberally distribute state aid, something they will increasingly seek to do. There are other unresolved issues: former state monopolists - starting with EDF, Enel, France Télécom, Deutsche Telekom - state aid for broadcasting, state aid in the event of structural adjustments and, in this context, also state aid disguised as something else. Mr President, I will close by saying that the Italian Radical Members will vote for the Riis-Jørgensen and Evans amendments, which will make the Herzog report more balanced.
costep_2009-05-05_3_4	Madam President, I wish to begin, like the other rapporteurs, Catherine Trautmann and Malcolm Harbour, by thanking them, firstly, for the extraordinary opportunity I have had to work on this reform of the European regulation of telecommunications markets because, in my view and still limited experience in this Parliament, it has been a model of cooperation between different Members from different groups. So, thank you very much. Naturally, I would next like to thank all those who contributed: the shadow rapporteurs and particularly the Secretariat of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which I think has played an absolutely fundamental role in reaching this point; also, may I thank the Commissioner and the Commission for facilitating all the difficult tripartite negotiations. I also wish to reiterate the efforts made by the Czech Presidency, from the very first faltering stages right up to this point at which the Czech Presidency has shown true leadership within the Council. I would like to express particular thanks for the efforts it has made. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a reform of a regulation that affects a key sector for the future of Europe: key to citizens' welfare and key to emerging from the deep crisis our economies now face, in Europe and elsewhere, but for now we are talking about the European Union. If there is one industry that can truly provide the catalyst and the boost we need to emerge from the crisis, it is precisely the information technologies and communications sector, that is, the electronic communications and telecommunications sector. That is why it is so extremely important that we have reached this agreement because it is going to enable us to move forward with an approach I consider to be the most crucial: keeping an open outlook, looking ahead, rejecting protectionism and, instead, encouraging competition and competitiveness; and the role of this sector is vital for that. With regard to the package - various aspects of the different reports have already been mentioned - I would just like to mention, as rapporteur of this report, the creation of a new body of European regulators in the electronic communications sector, a vital tool to ensure that the rules we are going to adopt tomorrow in the new regulation are applied consistently across the Union; that, in practice, there is harmonisation enabling the creation and development of a true internal market with internal competition, because that is the best way to ensure that consumers benefit and the best way to ensure that European consumers have the chance to enjoy the best services at the best prices. It is competition, and nothing else, that guarantees that end result and that benefit for consumers and for our economies. So then, let us say 'No!' to all forms of protectionism and 'Yes!' to openness and competition; the sector that can best ensure that is, indeed, the electronic communications sector and the telecommunications markets. We therefore have cause to celebrate.
costep_1997-10-01_8_7	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Graziani on his report and say that I am glad he is better and can be with us. I should like to raise two important points. This report on our relations with Canada is particularly important now, with all the talk of modernizing transatlantic relations. Right from the outset, and even during the most difficult moments, Canada has always supported the causes of Europe and freedom. This must be recognized and brought up to date. It is not just a question of discussions with the United States. There are two aspects I want to mention. Firstly, transatlantic relations are entering a new dimension now that Canada is also becoming involved in the creation of a free trade area with the United States - the NAFTA Treaty - which has also been extended to Mexico. At the moment there are even suggestions for a continental free trade area for the whole of America. This means that in the near future we too will have to reconsider not only our economic but also our political relations. We have to recognize this because it will have repercussions for us. Similarly, I think it is important to consider how our relations with Canada are affected by international law and relations within the framework of the WTO. In particular, I am thinking about extra-territorial laws, such as the Helms-Burton Act, which are as damaging to Canada as they are to the European Union. I think it is a good idea to combine our efforts in this respect. Finally, Mr President, I should like to mention fishing, which I think is an important aspect of the report. Mr Graziani has incorporated amendments in this area, some of them at my suggestion. As the previous speaker said, it is best if long-standing relations, such as concern fishing, can respect international law. We are well aware that fishing is a contentious matter, as shown by the current salmon war between the United States and Canada. As a former Community leader said, Jesus chose fishermen for his disciples because fishing can easily become contentious. In any case, I believe it is important to look to the future positively, by developing our relations in a climate of solidarity, cooperation and respect for international law.
costep_2010-02-10_10_176	This resolution includes some not insignificant advances on the part of the groups on the right that signed it: mention of the IPCC’s work, which refers to climate change, a call for greater involvement by civil society in the work of the Mexico conference, a call to the EU to push its targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond the 20% proposed for 2020. They are not enough, however, and the praise for the carbon market means that they lose all plausibility. The aid offered to the countries of the South, to which we owe a climate debt, is not enough. Similarly, the proposed aim of moving towards a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 is a long way from the 40% recommended by the IPCC. Moreover, no reference is made to the initiative of the Bolivian President Evo Morales Ayma’s People’s World Conference on Climate Change. To date, however, it alone proposes to the peoples of the world that they recognise their rights to the ecosystem and establish a court of climate justice.
costep_2008-09-04_9_1	I should like to state that the European Parliament’s resolution on Israel and Palestine is not quite appropriately timed in view of the latest developments, whereby Israel last week released another 198 Palestinian prisoners. This gesture gives evidence of Israel’s willingness to build mutual confidence in the peace process, despite a severely critical Israeli public. The same also applied to the recent exchange of prisoners on the Lebanese border. It is undoubtedly very sad that Israeli prisons are also holding Palestinian youths. The primary reason is, however, the fact that terrorist organisations are exploiting them, inciting hatred and a determination to kill. Over the last eight years, up to 16 % of suicide assassins and potential assassins have been minors and there has been a pronounced downward trend in age. Children’s upbringing and education are key factors which may have a significant effect on the future development of coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians.
costep_2002-12-16_1_31	Mr President, I am speaking to propose that this Parliament express its condemnation and rejection of the farcical presidential elections which took place in Equatorial Guinea. The lack of democratic guarantees and the obligation for the voters to indicate how they had voted led all the opposition candidates to withdraw their candidatures two hours after the beginning of the false electoral process. As you know, the current government of Teodoro Obiang did not allow the presence of observers from this Parliament nor international observers at these elections and, therefore, we believe that there are ample reasons for expressing a very firm and categorical condemnation of this electoral parody, which reflects the dictatorship suffered by the people of Guinea. Therefore, in the expectation that the plenum will express its opinion, we believe that, by means of its President or whatever channels he deems appropriate, we must express our condemnation of the lamentable electoral farce which took place yesterday.
costep_2007-07-10_10_35	I voted in favour of the excellent report by my Dutch fellow Member, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, on the proposal for a Council directive on critical infrastructure. Firstly, I applaud the vision of the European Council of June 2004, which is behind this proposal for a directive. It is, in fact, imperative that the European Union support the Member States in protecting critical infrastructure from the risks, including terrorist risks, that we face. Although the responsibility for this type of infrastructure lies with the Member States and the owners/operators who are generally linked to them, it is logical to communitise certain aspects of prevention, identification, designation of critical infrastructure, as well as the evaluation of the need to protect this infrastructure better. Internet development and the liberalisation of certain markets (electricity, gas, telecommunications, rail freight, etc.) must lead us to be more vigilant regarding our critical infrastructure, which is becoming more and more interconnected throughout Europe and of which the interruption, whether on a permanent or temporary basis, or destruction could have serious repercussions for health, security and the economic and social well-being of Europeans and for the proper functioning of the Member States' governments.
costep_2009-07-15_4_6	Mr President, allow me, first of all, to congratulate you on your election. I wish you every success over the next two and a half years. I was even able to understand your last request to keep to our speaking time without using headphones. Prime Minister, your predecessor did not have an easy or positive start. The emphasis was quite rightly placed on energy, economy and external relations, but as is so often the case in life, what happens in reality is sometimes very different to what we had planned. In the Gaza conflict, the Council Presidency rushed straight in without first having agreed on a common European approach. In the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine, millions of people were freezing before your government stepped forward and acted as an intermediary, with very successful results. Despite the criticism, you were also successful in other areas. It is a lasting achievement of the Czech Presidency that the European Union did not make the mistake of sliding into protectionism, as was the case in the 1930s. That was and still is a real danger. On this issue the Presidency took a clear line, supported in particular by the Competition Commissioner. Many people want to use the crisis to promote a new economic nationalism. That would be catastrophic. For Liberals and Democrats, free and fair competition, as provided for in the Treaties, is the way to growth and prosperity. However, if our citizens are to accept free competition, they want and need to be certain that the rules are the same for everyone. The distortion of competition, foreclosure, a preference for a state’s own national companies - all these things will lead not to the end of the crisis, but straight up a blind alley. During its Presidency, the Czech Republic, as a new Member State, rightly had to issue many old Member States with a call to order, which was unfortunately necessary in view of the fact that the internal market must not be eroded and rules must be followed. The Czech Government proved ultimately to be helpless in the face of the constant harassment from Prague Castle and the vote of no confidence. Its fall in the middle of its presidential term was unprecedented. The whole of Europe looked to Prague in amazement. With this move, the Czech political class did a disservice both to its own country and to Europe. Prime Minister, you have however shown that, in politics just as in football, a game can still turn even if substitutions are not made until it has gone into extra time. In the European Council in June the course was set for an overhaul of financial market supervision. It is now the task of the Commission to carry this initiative forward with determination. You have negotiated the guarantees for Ireland so that, hopefully, the referendum on 2 October will be successful. The Member States have formally agreed on a candidate for the office of President of the Commission and thus met an important demand by our group. Prime Minister, you personally have done a good job and gained a great deal of respect. However, the first Czech Presidency will probably not take the place in the history books that we had all hoped it would. What we nevertheless ought to remember is your motto: 'Europe without borders'.
costep_2004-10-25_1_16	Mr President, a heated dispute recently broke out between the European Commission and the German Government over the ‘golden share’, or the opportunity for the state to retain control over strategically important companies. The Polish Government supported the German Government in this matter, which is an important one, if only because a number of other Member States, such as France, have abandoned none of their influence on national and international economies. On the one hand, it is entirely possible to understand the logic of those who strongly advocate a free market, viewing such advocacy as an attempt to implement the Lisbon strategy and an opportunity to close the gap with America in time. Yet on the other hand, it is obvious that a number of governments and nations wish to protect national economic interests, even though they support European integration. Mr President, I propose that a debate should be held in Parliament on this matter. This crucial issue must cease to serve merely as the ball in a game of ping-pong between the Commission and individual countries.
costep_2003-03-10_1_28	Mr President, I would like to take advantage of the presence of the Commissioner, Mrs Reding, to ask her a specific question. I refer to what must certainly have been a rather embarrassing decision on the part of the Commission to abolish budget heading B3-1026 relating to the field of sport, which supported the programme entitled 'Sport: preparatory measures for a Community policy in the field of sport', on the basis of notice No 33 published in 2002 by the DG for Culture and Sport. This programme covered two themes: sport as a tool for educating young people and combating the scourge of doping. Without warning, the Commission said that there was no longer enough money because the funds had been absorbed by enlargement, an explanation which is decidedly inappropriate, particularly given that many projects had already been carried out and also in view of the fact that next year - as you are aware, Mr President - will be the Year of Educating Young People through Sport. This was to be a programme to prepare for the Year of Sport and it has been abolished. I would like to know why.
costep_2007-10-10_22_3	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks for finding the time to be present here this evening despite the late hour. Indeed, the issue under discussion is not just some unimportant, marginal one - it is the common agricultural policy. I would like to start by reminding the House what this common agricultural policy actually means to the vast majority of our nearly 500 million citizens. After all, it is with these citizens in mind that such plenary debates are held. Nevertheless, it can be noted in this regard that many citizens see the common agricultural policy first and foremost as an advertisement for the EU - but unfortunately an extremely bad one. Export subsidies, supposedly unfair trade with 'third world' countries, feed scandals, farmers' protests, excessive subsidies, genetically modified plants - the number of negatively perceived issues relating to the common agricultural policy is immense and unfathomable. Misdemeanours in the common agricultural policy have contributed significantly to the EU’s poor reputation in many parts of Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, this reputation is not something that can be dismissed out of hand this evening. This report, however - provided the Council supports it - could put the common agricultural policy on a new course, one that is closer to the ideas of the majority of citizens. I should like to start by discussing the Commission proposal once more. It essentially comprises four elements: transparency, i.e. the publication of the names of the beneficiaries of agricultural payments; introduction of the possibility of suspending payments to Member States under the first pillar in the case of serious breaches in their management and control systems; shortening of the periods of time for Commission auditing if Member States fail to comply with their control obligations (exceptions to the so-called 24-month rule); and adaptation of implementing powers. In political terms, the proposals on transparency are certainly of outstanding importance to the EP. With these, the Commission is finally implementing the decision of the Council and Parliament on the 2007 budget. In general I warmly welcome this project, although the Commission proposal is rather late in coming, probably partly owing to the incorporation of further facts into the text. Commission implementing regulations on the EAFRD are already envisaging publication of the names of all beneficiaries of payments under the second pillar. The other funds too (European Regional Development Fund, European Fisheries Fund, Cohesion Fund) now all contain publication rules. The budgetary decision has meant that, in essence, transparency has ceased to be controversial: it is no longer a case of if but only of how. Eleven Member States are already publishing all payments comprehensively. We need more transparency, therefore. The absence of transparency has allowed the emergence of rumours and campaigns of disinformation, which have harmed the CAP more than the odd actual error. The only problems are with the how: after all, the Commission gives no details of the procedure and wishes to lay down all the more detailed provisions in implementing regulations. As we are looking at an intrusion on the right of self-determination over personal data, my report proposes some clarifications regarding which data are to be published and under what conditions. These expressly follow an opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor. In spite of the desire for speedy implementation, data protection must be taken very seriously - and the European Parliament is doing so. The objectives of this report are as follows: greater transparency, and at the same time clearer data protection requirements. In addition, the general public must be informed. How can this balancing act be achieved? In my view, it is essential to inform those concerned in advance, and there is no transparency unless the figures mean something. Therefore, I propose differentiating more clearly, for example according to intervention purpose. My report proposes name, payment and place of residence/registered office. Nowadays, transparency means publication on the Internet. We are talking about the creation of a general Internet platform with links and references by the Commission. It is up to Member States to make the information comprehensible by means of the relevant explanations. Member States are permitted to publish the information at regional level, too, if they consider this appropriate. Different databases must be linked. In the Council, the issue of who publishes the information was very controversial. The financial management is mixed, so the Member States have clear responsibility - including under Article 53b of the budgetary decision. In addition, publication by the Commission would give rise to problems of legal protection, as persons affected by incorrect publication would have to go straight to the European Court of First Instance. This is neither citizen friendly nor particularly transparent. The Commission proposal is simpler, more transparent, less cumbersome to administer and more citizen friendly, and therefore has my support. It is in line with the provisions in all the other fields (the Structural Funds and the rules applying hitherto to the second pillar). As the publication of the information is to be seen in the context of budgetary control, my report proposes a (moderate) flat-rate fine for cases of failure to publish information. On the subject of penal reductions in funding, I would say that I am broadly in favour, but there are some points where I should like to see greater regard for the principle of proportionality. In the Committee on Budgetary Control, my fellow Member Mr Mulder made proposals concerning the budgetary dimension of the dossier, which I can wholeheartedly endorse. In the Opinion of the Committee on Budgets, the committee expressed its views on the transparency aspects, and these largely correspond with my proposals. Ladies and gentlemen, and particularly members of the Council, this report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I hope for a large majority in tomorrow’s vote, too. I implore the Council and the Commission to take this vote by the representatives of the European people seriously. There will also no doubt be a correlation between this report and the way all those involved deal with it, and the expected Health Check. We will undoubtedly return to this subject when we deal with the Health Check.
costep_2010-03-09_7_111	The previous legislation, which did not allow a citizen of a third country with a long-stay visa granted by a Member State to travel to other Member States, did not meet the mobility needs of the majority of those citizens. We are talking about students, scientists, academics and others who, as part of their professional and/or academic work, need to travel between several Member States, and would not be able to do so under the existing legislation. In this way, these changes are rectifying this anomalous situation while still continuing to safeguard all security rules on the movement of citizens of third countries within the EU.
costep_1998-11-17_4_19	Mr President, I should like to express more than the conventional expressions of gratitude to the rapporteur, and also to put forward four ideas that would, in my view, enrich the report. Firstly, I regret the lack of any reference to the coordination of economic policies with monetary policy, that is to say, of the Economy and Finance Council with the European Central Bank. Recent publications, particularly Krugmann’s work, are beginning to call into question whether it is logical and coherent to continue giving priority to price stability now that we have reached all-time low levels where job creation is concerned. Although I agree with Carlos Gasòliba that economic stability is a prerequisite for job creation, I also believe that greater coordination is needed and that the European Central Bank should focus more on this objective. Secondly, I think it is unfortunate that when comparing - benchmarking - job creation in Europe and in the United States, the experience gained by this Parliament was not drawn upon. Apart from some ideas reiterated in this House by a number of speakers - flexibility and the liberalisation of certain markets, particularly the service market and the labour market -, the report emphasised that one of the main reasons why the United States takes the lead where job creation is concerned is that it is far more committed to research and development. Also, private initiative plays a much greater part in that joint effort and there is an option of encouraging R&D through tax incentives rather than direct aid, thus linking projects to making a profit. Thirdly, with regard to the tax burden, there is reference to VAT on labour-intensive services. It seems to me that the time has come to ask ourselves whether it makes sense to maintain a value added tax such as the one devised in 1967 when there was a shortage of labour in Europe, and jobs remained unfilled. It might well be appropriate to consider whether it is still reasonable to allow immediate deduction of the tax on investment goods thus encouraging the replacement of workers by capital goods. My concluding remark is that I agree with the references to trans-European networks, but it is time to move on and say how we intend to finance them: from surplus reserves, issuing loans or in some other way.
costep_2008-09-01_16_26	President, colleagues, at the beginning of July Filip Dimitrov, our first democratically elected prime minister of Bulgaria, retired from politics. Filip Dimitrov was among the founders of democratic opposition in Bulgaria, he took over the governance of the state from the disintegrated communist regime in the beginning of the 1990s, was a representative in the European parliament and, finally, Deputy Chairman of the Bulgarian National Assembly. In all the eighteen years when Mr. Dimitrov was in politics, to all of us who knew him, he served as an example of honesty, openness and a man who to the very depths of his soul believes in the European, Euro-Atlantic choice of our country, in the freedom of speech, in democracy and human rights. I am convinced that in spite of his retirement from politics, with his advice and with his experience he will continue to help all of us return to our state the image it deserves to have because of the efforts of people like Filip Dimitrov.
costep_1998-12-15_7_15	Madam President, as has already been stated, there is no doubt that this budget is a historic one. However, in my view, it is not historic because Mrs Dührkop is the first female Iberian Member to be appointed general rapporteur - although I congratulate her on her work - nor is it historic because it is the last budget of the current 1993-1999 financial perspective and because it is certainly going to influence the next financial perspective, if there is one, which is not yet certain. Nor is it historic, in my view, merely because it is the first budget in euros. We knew all this when the budgetary procedure began. In my opinion, it is historic because, in the course of this budgetary procedure, the Council has promised in writing, and this morning it repeated that promise verbally, that it would respect what it has signed. We have managed to get the Council to make a momentous declaration here. Some people may be surprised to know that it is the first time in 40 years that the Council has made a unilateral declaration stating that it will respect its commitments. This might seem evident and redundant to some people, but it has not been the case in the history of the Community. This Council declaration relates to the question of flexibility in the future financial perspective, which we would like to sign and to have, but not - and I would stress this point - at any price. Ladies and gentlemen, the basis for my current negotiating mandate is the resolution of 4 December 1997 in which Parliament gave its support to a new financial perspective that would be adequate to meet the challenges that the European Union will face in the coming years. Parliament accepts as a practical necessity the own resources ceiling of 1.27 % and calls for mechanisms to provide flexibility: on the one hand, review clauses for the financial perspective; and on the other hand, mechanisms that speed up the process of transferring funds between categories and mobilising new resources when necessary. In a working document several months ago, I pointed out that the problem stemmed from paragraph 12 of the current Interinstitutional Agreement, which provides for the financial perspective to be reviewed in accordance with the majorities provided for in Article 203(9) of the Treaty. However, the Council had voted unanimously for an internal decision that prevented any degree of flexibility. To put an end to this inflexibility, we tabled the so-called strategic amendments. In my opinion, these can now be withdrawn following last week’s agreement. I must point out that Amendment No 708 on the Structural Funds from the first reading followed a certain logic that the Council has now broken. It has removed the commitment appropriations from the reserve and added them to the heading, while maintaining the reduction in payment appropriations. Frankly, in this situation I would prefer to go back to the preliminary draft budget. What do the Member States hope to save through this? At best, they will gain the interest on EUR 500 million at 3 %. At the most, Germany would save between EUR 2 million and EUR 3 million over the year. That is the maximum that can be saved. Is this a symbolic gesture? Clearly, what counts are the commitment appropriations, but we are going to have to explain that we have only cut the payment appropriations, which do not really have much of an effect. The analysis has already been made in the press and simply indicates that there has been a reduction in the Structural Funds. And as far as symbols go, Madam President, I prefer that of solidarity.
costep_1999-12-17_6_5	Mr President, for our part, we will not be voting for the Savary report. This is both for reasons concerning the choice of this country and out of more general considerations involving financial aid. Although, of course, we have nothing against the sovereign State of Tajikistan, we nevertheless do not think that European States should drop their priorities, or to be more precise, the priority that they set a long time ago on the subject of cooperation. This priority has now been in force for more than a quarter of a century through the Lomé Agreements. For obvious reasons, which concern history as well as geography, Europeans felt it necessary to embark, throughout the 1970s, on a major course of cooperation with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific in a way which is, moreover, highly original, known as the Lomé Agreements, which enable us to offer our Southern partners the benefits of stable prices for the produce which constitute their essential resources, protecting them from all-out free trade. Today we see only too well how this ruins the weakest economies. Now under the battering, not from globalisation but from the globalist ideology, which European countries have accepted without closer examination, we have seen the ACP agreements being slowly dismantled over several years, their basic principles denied and, above all, we have seen reductions in several European countries' contributions to the EDF. Now, at the same time, so-called exceptional financial aid to the most diverse countries in the world is multiplying, without any overall plan emerging, which means that our cooperation policy is nothing but a vague, huge scratching of the surface or, to sum it up, it is no longer a policy at all. To this particular consideration we can add a second. Tajikistan may have been spared the economic problems described in the report, moreover like so many other countries in the world, but it is nevertheless the victim of an ill-considered opening up of its borders and of the huge game waged by empires. For our part, the best solution we can see would be to restore a new world trade order, which respects the sovereignty of States, their pace and their modes of development, and which also respects their traditions, traditions which we will not be able to make vanish with a wave of a magic wand just by imposing an election, human rights and what we quite hastily call democracy.
costep_2008-05-08_9_42	Every year we are confronted with this exercise in hypocrisy of the European Parliament on human rights in the world. Obviously the report contains points which we support. However, in essence, it is a perfect example of the instrumentalisation of human rights and their unacceptable use as a political weapon in favour of the interests of the EU’s major powers, and their large financial and economic groups, and against those people who reject their dictates. As such, there is a total absence of any references to and denouncements of the flagrant violations of human rights in Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, occupied Cyprus or the Western Sahara, as perpetrated by EU countries and/or their allies such as the US, Israel, Turkey or Morocco. As such, there is once again an attempt to dissociate human rights, by subordinating them to economic and social rights. The defence of human rights - including the fact that they are indivisible and cannot be ranked - and their status as a prerequisite for respect for the rights of people and for genuine social justice, peace, freedom and democracy must form the framework of our political action. For us they are about defending the rights of people, not exercises in hypocrisy.
costep_2002-09-03_2_110	The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is also right to be concerned at the increasing need for imports of often genetically modified soya cake from the United States, Brazil and Argentina. The EU currently imports almost twice as much cattle feed as it produces itself. The old solution of feeding animal meal and slaughter waste to cows as a source of protein is no longer possible since the advent of mad cow disease, or BSE, but that is the only change that seems to be generally accepted now. We are still not able to raise questions about how we produce our food in general. Is it reasonable to deliberately feed vegetable matter to pigs and then to eat the pigs ourselves, bearing in mind that the meat of these animals has less nutritional value than the original product? Is it reasonable to lift the ban on including fishmeal in processed animal feed as an additional source of protein? The oceans are being fished until they are empty, and the fishermen of the South now respond to all proposals for limiting catches by accusing the North of causing the problem by producing fishmeal. A better part of the proposal is the idea that farmers should grow more leguminous and oil-producing plants as part of a crop rotation system.
costep_1998-11-04_7_13	Mr President, I have to admit that I have found it very difficult to take a firm position in an argument which is still very obscure and difficult to assess. It is also true that when we are discussing health we ought to avoid Khomeini-like positions, because research has often overturned received wisdom. Yet we cannot disregard one fundamental concept that has been stated for many years in pharmacology and medical text books in the European Community and throughout the rest of the world, which is that the patient should be treated with the maximum dose for the minimum possible time. This concept is overturned and denied by homeopathy, which maintains a very low - infinitesimal - dose for a prolonged period. It is true that these concepts are, like all science, not fixed in stone, but it is equally clear that science needs to find an answer not only for the authorities, but above all for consumers, and that answer must reconcile those two facts. In particular, science needs to clarify the immunity problem arising from a possible choice between conventional and homeopathic during treatment. Some maintain that prolonged low doses divert the immune system so that it is unable to deal with anything else, which is a serious threat to health. Other scientists challenge that assertion, claiming that an infinitesimal dose does not stimulate the immune response. Obviously we are not scientific researchers in a position to clarify these concepts, so we need, and we should be able to expect, clear answers from research. There are also some questions from Professor Cabrol to be answered if homeopathy is to be dignified as a medical science proper. I do have some comments on Mr Chanterie’s excellent report, in which, like Professor Cabrol, some passages left me very perplexed. My first point is that standards for the authorisation and registration of pharmaceuticals differ from one Member State to another. Of course we think harmonisation is essential but it must not mean any reduction in the present levels of safety and protection of health. Secondly, Chapters IV and V of Directive 92/75 on principles and guidelines for good production and laboratory practices must also be applied in full to all homeopathic medicinal products. Thirdly, the Member States must draw up the lists of homeopathic medicines or themselves take responsibility for banning them. Fourthly, until it is scientifically proven that homeopathic medicinal products for veterinary use do not involve risks to human health, we think the simplified registration procedure is inapplicable. Tinctures in particular must be subject to rigorous scientific tests to establish what degrees of dilution guarantee the safety of the food chain and protection from contaminated preparations.
costep_2011-01-20_6_10	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if the Black Sea region is to develop into an area of stability, security, democracy and prosperity and if these opportunities and challenges are to be fulfilled, we need an all-embracing strategy. This resolution pursues that objective and is therefore supported by my group. This is also because a number of our proposals have been included, for example, dealing with the unresolved conflicts in the region, improving cooperation in civil society, support for people-to-people projects and the promotion of small projects in the context of cross-border cooperation. We also want to see a sustainable energy policy, greater energy efficiency and the establishment of academic and student networks. However, what I would criticise is the lack of a coherent position in relation to the question of the energy infrastructure in the region - I would mention Nabucco and South Stream in this context. I fail to understand why our call for stricter monitoring of oil rigs in the Black Sea has been rejected. This is absolutely essential following the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. It is for this reason that we are presenting this amendment once again today.
costep_2009-02-03_7_77	We do not have a single European energy policy. Each state defends its own interests. An additional EUR 5 billion have been allocated to EU electricity connections and broadband Internet. This is an historic event as, for the first time in the history of the EU, the European Commission debated the budget again and proposed such a project. This is especially important for Lithuania since, so far, it has neither an electricity link with Sweden nor one with Poland and is an energy island. Energy links are investments which do not reap many rewards financially. Therefore, such vitally important projects should be financed with EU funds. Today, Lithuania buys gas for around USD 500, while other EU states, which are much further from Russia than Lithuania, pay less for gas. We would gain a lot by showing solidarity and speaking with one voice to Gazprom about pricing.
costep_2000-11-30_1_9	Mr President, the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 95/21/EC deals with the selection of ships for inspection and items for inspection. Amending the directive in terms of greater stringency in its application and the harmonisation of legislation, especially regarding the selection of ships for inspection and the scope of the different types of selection is clearly a positive step. Even then, the European Union would need to ensure that current legislation is enforced by the Member States. The fact is that Belgium, Denmark, Portugal, France, Ireland and the Netherlands, which are obliged to inspect 25% of ships, do not do so. Worse still, the existing directives, even though they date from 1995, have still not been transposed into national legislation in Italy and Portugal. In order for Member States to enforce existing legislation, they must allocate sufficient resources to inspections so as to ensure the proper application of international conventions and the directive amended by the European Parliament. In concrete terms, this means employing additional inspectors, broadening the competences and the scope of inspection, notably concerning respect for social standards and for shipboard living and working conditions, and their publication. Since human error is the root cause of 70% of accidents, the inspection of crews, their living and working conditions, their level of training and their numbers must be an integral part of a ship’s inspection. Non-compliance with these standards must be a reason to detain a ship and to impose sanctions. Furthermore, the Commission proposals still do not go far enough: they, in fact, concern no more than twenty or so ships. The positions adopted by the French Presidency, which we have heard elsewhere, which would water down the Commission proposals even further, such as amending the proportion of ships targeted with the aim of reducing inspections by half, are naturally unacceptable. I am in complete agreement with the rapporteur about refusing port access to ships posing a serious risk, irrespective of age, and those that have been flying a flag of convenience for more than three years. We must also go further and ban them from sailing in Community waters. To this end, we must strengthen international maritime law. Moreover, it seems to me that we need to be more restrictive concerning flags of convenience, especially those of Member States, as well as those, Minister, of the islands of Kerguelen, Wallis and Fortuna in the case of France. I will support this report and the Commission’s amendments, but I call on the Members of Parliament to also support the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on social standards.
costep_1998-04-01_7_13	Mr President, the British Presidency has made a good start with the two-track approach. This has been expressed through symbolic events. One was the strengthened accession partnership which it tackled in a highly directive manner. The other, which is clearly related in spirit, but does not form part of the accession process, was the multilateral consultation and the European Conference where everyone is more on an equal footing. This is a good thing, and has been effectively put into practice. The Presidency emphasized that priority must given to good governance, democracy and human rights. It did not just confine itself to economic issues. It also talked about the environment, and so forth. I believe that this is an important issue. The third pillar is becoming increasingly important for the European Union, because we are characterized by the fact that we are an association of democratic constitutional states. In order that accession countries achieve this as well, it is of extreme importance that they undergo cultural change. In this context I am a little surprised at what is sometimes said about Turkey. My question to the President-in-Office is whether Turkey has in fact made clear, substantive policy changes, so that it becomes obvious that we have been wrong? Is there no need for Turkey to take any further steps, and will it be increasingly received with laurels the more arrogantly it approaches the discussions surrounding the European Conference? I think it is a little strange to pretend that the usefulness and value of the European Conference depends on the presence of a state which is not a constitutional state. It is much easier to talk about the third pillar with countries which are constitutional states and full democracies. I would like to ask the President-in-Office what his thoughts are about this, and whether he is getting any signals that Turkey is making substantive steps towards us, instead of our being forced to make steps towards Turkey. The second point I wanted to make is about the foreign policy convergence of which the President-in-Office spoke. Will some kind of action plan be developed during the British Presidency to achieve convergence in foreign policy? We will have to arrive at a situation in which European politicians do not only inspire confidence in their own country, but amongst all European citizens, so that they can see that European responsibilities are dealt with effectively and thoroughly by the European authorities.
costep_1999-12-13_3_15	Mr President, as has already been said, unfortunately, overall, Seattle was not a great success: the only real participants were the protestors, who, while their demands were supported by many extremely valid grounds, wrongly thought that the failure of the Summit itself would constitute a victory, a solution to the serious problems in question. In reality, the problems and contradictions of the global economy are still there, unresolved and still relevant: doubts about genetically modified organisms, child labour, the negative social effects of unbridled, unregulated globalisation. But that is not all: perhaps these protests served as a pretext for the official participants at Seattle - those with the right to sit round the conference table - not to have to fully assume the political responsibility to negotiate, which, although certainly very difficult is absolutely necessary, precisely as regards social rights and safeguarding our citizens' health. These are negotiations that cannot wait any longer. Of course, we are dealing with a complicated process, but Europe has to be equal to the challenges facing it. Talks within the World Trade Organisation have to start up again, and Europe has to be very aware of its role, a role of balance and responsibility, with a view to globalisation with a human aspect that is open and welcomes changes and acceleration in the economy but is also able to safeguard equal employment opportunities, the environment and health. Finally, Europe must not forget to defend our own specific differences, not just economic but also cultural and social, because globalisation that leads to uniformity, levelling out and exploitation must have no place at all in the European growth model.
costep_1999-07-21_5_10	Madam President, President of the Commission, in January this year, Parliament adopted Mr Brok’s report recommending that the majority of the new Commissioners be Members of the European Parliament, people with experience in the European institutions. It requested sufficiently equal numbers of men and women representatives and an adequate balance of political trends. I leave it to you and to this Parliament to assess to what extent you have complied, or been able to comply with this Parliamentary resolution. Mr President, you went so far as to announce an era of change, a revolution - in which I wish you every success - and mentioned an internal restructuring which maybe Mr Kinnock will elaborate upon; the fifth, I may add, in seven years! I assure you, however, that it will not be a change in the number of Directorates-General, the fact they are called by name instead of by number, the fact that the homes of the Commissioners are scattered all over Brussels or that the use of a spokesman is consolidated which will bring the institutions closer to the great European public, the objective you referred to. What is currently lacking in Europe and our institutions is a fresh vision of the Europe of the beginning of the next millennium. Today, we live in a situation which is post Berlin wall, post Kohl, post Mitterand, post single currency, post initiation of enlargement, and pre-hardly anything. This is the vision, the challenge. For us radicals, the Federalist compass of Altiero Spinelli will remain an appreciation gauge, a very clear compass, which will show us whether our institutions are moving towards the consolidation of the Union, towards a more European Europe and towards political union. This, I believe, is the challenge which must unite us in the diversity of our roles, in the knowledge that those who have brought us thus far, Mr President, present and past colleagues, may deserve greater respect and perhaps even a little more generosity of spirit. Applause from the left
costep_2008-09-04_9_21	Mr President, I am voting in favour of this document, but I wish to point out that it is the umpteenth text approved by this House in support of respect for human rights in this part of the world. What effect do our declarations have? Very little, unfortunately, apart from expressing political solidarity. If Europe wishes to be credible on this matter, it must speak with a single voice and place international security above individual national interests. I believe that it is vital to strike a balance between two requirements: for the Palestinians, a free and independent state; for the Israelis, the security of living in their own territory, free from attacks and threats. If the two aspects are separated, it becomes rather awkward to find a credible stance and a lasting solution. I hope that in future this European Union of ours, which has such an interest in peace in a part of the world so close to us, will be able to play a more effective mediating role than it has done in the past.
costep_2007-05-23_9_5	Mr President, I shall begin by commenting on something we have just heard. You said, Prime Minister, that your government is in favour of a legal framework for services. Thank you very much for that; now perhaps you can say that to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to whom you have close links, who, this morning, rejected that very idea. I would like, Prime Minister, to refer to two of the observations you made, and which I see as the most important things you said in your speech. 'I hope that we can concentrate on what unites us and not on what divides us.' That was an encouraging thing to say. Until then, we had been under the impression that the Netherlands was focusing on what divides us rather than on what unites us. If that is meant to be an announcement to the effect that you and your government are willing to make compromises rather than insisting that the Dutch 'no' must result in fundamental change in Europe, if it is meant to mean that the Dutch 'no' means that the Constitution will not enter into force in its present form, but instead in some other, with some other comprehensive reform that will make the European Union more efficient, and that you, to that end, are prepared to make compromises and then defend them at home, then that, Mr Balkenende, was a good speech. Applause By it, then, we will judge you, for I was in Rome, where we met, and where I saw you sign the Constitution with a golden pen. As you know, I keep a watchful eye on Dutch domestic politics. Compared with the other battles you have had to endure in the Netherlands, the battle for the constitution was - if I may put it that way - a rather restrained one. Nobody will regret it if you land more punches in future. Europe must learn to land more punches, but it will not do that on the basis on Nice or of 'Nice minus'; that will not make Europe a better fighter, but rather less able to take the action that needs to be taken in such situations as that in the Middle East, where, it is worth remembering, 13 000 European troops are stationed on the border between Lebanon and Israel in pursuance of the UNIFIL mandate, and I ask you also to think of the Gaza Strip in Palestine, where we are in the thick of the chaos, and where the place is getting like Somalia. Why is Europe not represented there by a foreign minister who could get something done? It is because of the unanimity rule in the Council, which is preventing Europe from taking action. Applause I have nothing against Calvinistic self-denial. I gather that you want no more flags, no anthem, and no foreign minister. Good: Beethoven’s symphonies have survived revolutions and wars; they will outlive the European Constitution too. Applause As the President of our Parliament introduced this debate in Dutch, I, too, Prime Minister, should like speak a few words in it. If, in future, the Foreign Affairs Minister is called the High Representative of Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands, then I have no problem with that, provided that he does his job. What is crucial is not what he is called, but rather what he is meant to do. Applause I am a great admirer of the Dutch people; the Netherlands is a wonderful country with a great tradition, a country with a tradition of seafaring, and seafarers have always been courageous people. It was Dutch people who first sailed round Cape Horn and gave it its name. I, for one, get the feeling that they have today embarked on a ship and set the sails. Mr Goebbels has already pulled the flag down to half mast. I am less sceptical; I get the impression that you, today, have hoisted the flag halfway up again, so I urge you to hoist it all the way up, and I can promise you that this House will put wind in your sails, so that then, Mr Balkenende, you will be sailing towards a compromise. Yesterday saw Mr Prodi expressing his own willingness to compromise; he is completely in favour of the Constitution. If you want half a constitution and you and he can meet one another halfway, we will end up with three-quarters of it, and a 75% constitution would be the Constitution without the anthem, without the flag and with a foreign minister called by another title. It would be a good result. Applause
costep_2009-03-11_3_33	Western Europe likes to talk about the need to assist the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to overcome the crisis. However, the very same people, or Mr Sarkozy to be precise, speak of these countries as a black hole which represents a risk for the European Union. I reject such a trivial generalisation of a problem which is affecting western countries in exactly same way. The result of such pronouncements is a loss of faith in the institutions of the Central and Eastern European countries and they look more like a stab in the back than a form of assistance. European leaders last week rejected protectionism, which would have meant erecting a new iron curtain across a united Europe. At the same time, however, the European Commission has approved enormous state aid for French car makers. However, this unequal and discriminatory approach is also apparent in other areas and particularly in agriculture. Europe is becoming two-faced and the Euro sceptics will reap the rewards of this.
costep_1997-03-14_3_5	Madam President, in some European wine-growing regions we are witnessing an escalating crisis of excess production which should be eliminated immediately by a carefully structured programme of action. We support Mr Martin’s report, because it contains not only immediate measures to achieve this but also useful suggestions for the future. The immediate measures are those proposed by the Commission for the 1996, 1997 and 1998 wine years, but they are merely a stopgap. They do not solve the whole problem. This is why our group studied the second part of the report, on the improvement of the grubbing-up procedure, with the greatest interest. The need now is for the Commission to move quickly to present proposals aimed at reforming the common organization of the wine-growing markets, a project which has been hanging fire for two years although the European Parliament previously made proposals on the occasion of the Fantuzzi report. As far as this reform is concerned, the abandonment aspect must take due account of the rapporteur’s proposal. Apart from the looming crisis, it is absolutely essential to preserve a future for our wine-growing regions. The only way of achieving that is voluntary, temporary grubbing-up rather than permanent abandonment. It is a matter for regret that the House did not follow our lead on the occasion of the 1996-97 price package by voting in favour of the amendments proposed by our group, which have now been adopted by the rapporteur. We were told at that time that there were no wine surpluses. Well, we know today that the European Union has had to distil no less than 15 million hectolitres during the present wine year. What a waste! What losses for our wine-growers! Let us retain a degree of flexibility in the management of wine-growing enterprises, through temporary grubbing-up. And let us remember that any permanent abandonment entails the equally permanent loss of the right of production, and that the land thus released can no longer receive aid under the CAP. Regarding the specific case of Charentes, it would be suicidal to abandon permanently, as some people have nevertheless suggested, some 20, 000 hectares - 25 % of the wine-growing potential of the region. Those vineyards would be allowed to lie fallow, and we would see the loss of a vital economic asset in that region and the destruction of a traditional human equilibrium. For these reasons, we urge that the reform of the common organization of the markets be pursued as soon as possible.
costep_2002-09-24_2_88	Mr President, if Commissioner Wallström will forgive me, last night, I dreamt of her too. Why is that? Because I had met a GMO who said to me - none of us know what GMOs look like - that he, in his turn, had dreamt he was Ulysses, tied up so as not to succumb to the temptation of the sirens, and that he had seen a beautiful GMO - resembling Mrs Wallström - which called to him: 'Follow me, follow me and you will be happy.' But it was only a dream, Mr President: reality is different. I therefore voted against the report, despite the fact that I was convinced in my dream that I should follow the recommendations of the siren, Commissioner Wallström.
costep_2007-02-13_11_20	As Mrs Fischer Boel’s speech confirmed, the main purpose of her intended reform of the common organisation of the market in wine is to use the grubbing up of vines as a means of balancing the winemaking market. This means that the least developed regions and in particular family farms and farmers on low incomes would be worst affected, which would have a disastrous social environmental effect and would lead to the increased desertification and, in turn, abandonment of rural areas. For vast areas of countries of the South, in countries such as Portugal, the consequences could be disastrous, on a par with the tragedy of the summer forest fires. We therefore place the emphasis on protecting vine and wine cultivation, which has played a central role in European, and in particular Mediterranean, civilisation. We want to see our farmers producing better and better wine and maintaining potable alcohol distillation. We are opposed to the downplaying of producing wine from grapes, replacing it with industrial wine resulting from the import of must from third countries. Commissioner, our high-quality wines must be defended.
costep_2002-04-09_2_7	Madam President, this proposal for a Regulation implements Resolution 1390, adopted on 16 January of this year by the United Nations Security Council, pursuant to Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. With regard to the 30 days required for signatory States to adopt the measures that correspond to the implementation of the aforementioned United Nations Resolution, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs yesterday voted in favour of the urgency procedure and for there to be a procedure without report, that is to say, that it should pass directly to plenary with time for amendments to be tabled by the political groups. I would ask the Presidency to set a long deadline for the tabling of amendments to take account of these circumstances. I would like to make two further observations. The first is that, in order to implement Resolutions such as Resolution 1390, the European Union should take two different types of action: one which corresponds to the second pillar, common foreign and security policy, and another within the framework of the EC Treaty. Yesterday, the Commission almost unanimously came to the conclusion that Parliament should work on the development of instruments in the second pillar, in other words, the development of the common position that is being adopted at this time. And, if Parliament is not involved, it should at very least be kept informed, for what is laid down in the Treaty is one issue, and common sense and the idea that this House is the true representative of citizens' interests is quite another. My second observation is that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has expressed a great deal of concern in this regard and will formally request that the Council and those Member States that form part of the United Nations Security Council make use of those procedural mechanisms needed to correct possible non-justified inclusions of names of natural or legal persons in these lists. This is currently the cause of much public concern in EU Member States. Finally, we would ask the Commission not to force us to take this kind of action. Parliament cannot seriously be expected to support this decision with only five days notice, for it is not really a question of issuing an opinion, but of supporting this United Nations Resolution, when the Resolution was passed on 19 January. We would ask that in future we be more rapidly involved in the process of drawing up this type of Regulation in order that this Parliament can provide its support with full knowledge of the facts and not, as in this case, in a truly unbalanced effort.
costep_1999-09-14_5_3	Mr President-designate of the Commission, if we had to choose here and now between your opponents and the reasons they have given and you, we would find ourselves in a predicament, maybe to the point of abstaining, indeed even to voting for you, as the arguments of the last communists and allies of Milosevic against NATO and our countries and against British conservatives and others are so weak and worthless. But we must judge you and decide whether to put our confidence in you on the basis of your statements and what we know about you, leaving these statements to one side. As European federalists, we can have absolutely no confidence in you whatsoever. The picture you painted of politics and the programme lacked all mention of the urgent institutional problems or supranational issues. As liberals and liberalists we know, especially from your references to the programme, that we run the risk of importing the postcorporate and postfascist heritage into Europe which has characterised the so-called mixed economy of Italian party politics. Finally, as Italians, we fear that through you on the continental political stage, there will be a return to sharing the spoils of party power which goes against every notion of the Constitutional State, every effective feeling of a Europe which stands for progress with regard to revolution and the reform of freedom and rights, progress in this sense. And so I, along with the other elected Members from the Bonino list, announce our determination to vote against you and we clearly refuse to put our confidence in you.
costep_2001-11-29_2_132	This is one of the fundamental issues to which the very notion of compromise has no relevance and which presents us with radical choices. This is the case with human genetics, where the unassailable dignity of the human being is at stake. The dividing lines running through this Parliament were clearly illustrated by the vote on the Fiori report. There is a liberal-libertarian line which exploits the flag for research freedom and claims that there is a so-called need not to be left behind by the United States and calls for European Union funding of research into embryonic stem cells and surplus cells, thereby opening the floodgates to the reification and the marketing of emerging human life, at an extreme stage of its embryonic fragility, to the development of actual embryo farms, where human embryos would be created for the sole purpose of killing them and cultivating their cells. The so-called compromise approach seems particularly hypocritical and is simply an indirect means of authorising therapeutic cloning. It consists of accepting the funding of research into cell lines obtained from embryonic stem cells, which means the destruction of embryos and affectively authorises therapeutic cloning, since cell lines do not have the same genetic heritage as the receiver suffering from an incurable disease. The third position, which we support, and which has been defended competently and with conviction by Elizabeth Montfort, consists of rejecting any exceptions when it comes to the dignity of the human being, at whatever stage of development. We demand that the prohibition of cloning be maintained and we reject the false distinction between reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning, since they are exactly the same process. We demand the prohibition of research into embryonic stem cells and surplus embryos and we demand concerted support for research into adult stem cells, the therapeutic applications of which are particularly promising.
costep_1999-01-27_2_29	Mr President, we have talked about implementation of the nitrates directive on a number of occasions already. In reply to a written question of mine, the Commission said recently that there were no uniform rules for sampling groundwater to check whether the directive was being implemented correctly. That seems to me a very feeble basis for monitoring legislation. When is that going to improve? My second question is this: nitrate in groundwater can come from sources other than animal manure. It also comes from artificial fertiliser and from factories, sewage treatment plants and so on. How does the Commission intend to differentiate between nitrate in groundwater from these sources and nitrate from animal manures, so that the burden is not placed entirely on agriculture?
costep_2011-06-23_14_510	An improved economic governance framework should be built on stronger national ownership of rules and policies and a more robust surveillance framework at the European level of national economic policies. The governance framework must be reformed extensively. In order to ensure that the provisions of the regulation on microeconomic imbalances in the euro area can be properly implemented and achieve the objectives outlined, a differentiated system of sanction allocation must be established. Consequently interest-bearing deposits must be applied to a Member State if it fails to comply with recommendations and does not carry out the corrective actions proposed by the Council. In cases of repetitive non-compliance with the recommendations, the interest-bearing deposits are converted into a yearly fine. I agree with the proposal that the interest-bearing deposit and the fine should be identical for Member States whose currency is the euro, in order to ensure equal treatment for all Member States. Only a strong and independent Commission can properly supervise and give directions in the new deeper and wider economic policy surveillance framework. Consequently, the Commission needs to be given the right to recommend reducing the size of a sanction or to cancel it in exceptional economic circumstances. Meanwhile the power to adopt individual decisions for the application of the sanction should be conferred on the Council.
costep_2005-11-16_1_246	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate our rapporteur on the perceptiveness she has shown in this matter, and we fully support her proposal to reject the Commission proposal. We can also endorse her arguments. Nevertheless, I would like to stress a few points. First of all, Commissioner, I would like to say that I very much appreciate the preparations you have made in terms of following up this project, in view of the European Parliament’s position. I would like to stress how inconsistent the Commission’s management of this issue of humane trapping has been. We must remember that, in 1998, the European Parliament rejected the conclusion of tripartite agreements with Russia, Canada and the United States, because it felt that they were not ambitious enough to be effective. Unlike today’s events, though, the vote in 1998 was of no consequence, because the Council could have concluded the agreements even against Parliament’s wishes. This time, however, the Commission has proposed a European directive to implement those same agreements, in other words a project that does not achieve the objectives it has set itself. So why, under such circumstances, would Parliament accept such a weak proposal? That is our question to the Commission. With regard to the content, too, we find this proposal unacceptable. Not only has it been criticised by scientists, as my fellow Members have already said, and by animal welfare organisations, but it also does nothing to reduce the suffering of trapped animals. In this connection, I think we must look at the arguments put forward by Mrs Scheele, who explains quite specifically that we are not reducing this suffering at all. One final, vital point: this draft is unacceptable because, at the end of the day, it flouts European law, in that its positive list includes species protected under Article 12 of the Habitat Directive. It includes the otter, the wolf, the beaver and the lynx. And you know, Commissioner - and I am well aware of this, coming from France - how difficult it is to enforce the Habitat Directive, to protect wolves and to try to explain the situation. It is therefore for all these reasons that we are rejecting this proposal and that, in truth, Commissioner, we are counting on you to act as an intermediary between Parliament and the Commission and to get it to withdraw this draft.
costep_1999-03-11_3_7	Madam President, I am surprised that compromise amendments have been admitted at this stage in the debate. The report was the subject of many committee meetings and it was even considered by the political groups before it was debated in the House. Since the deadline for tabling amendments has passed, I object to the fact that we are putting Amendment No 182 to the vote because the request was tabled too late. To go back to the question I just raised, regarding the request for a split vote, I should like to remind you that the deadline for tabling requests for split votes and separate votes was Tuesday evening and not yesterday evening.
costep_2010-12-16_4_27	Mr President, there can be no debate about the fact that farmers must adapt to the 1999 directive. We understand those farmers who have already invested money in modernising cages. We are not talking about giving more time to some farmers than others, as one of the previous speakers said, but about giving the same amount of time to everyone to meet the requirements made of them and to ensure that the standards are met. The terms 'illegal production' and 'consumer care' have a very nice ring to them, but I would like to know why we do not show the same determination in protecting consumers against the consumption of imported eggs produced in conditions which do not meet the requirements introduced in the EU. I always try to understand the situation of different groups of farmers in the individual countries, and I am in favour of solutions that help them, since I know that as a group, they are in an exceptionally difficult situation in terms of revenue. It is a shame that others in this House do not share the same view.
costep_2004-10-27_1_154	Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to thank you for your detailed answer. I have just one additional question; you referred to monitoring, which, if I understood you correctly, will be carried out primarily by the Association Council. My question, prompted by specific inquiries from the people who live in my electoral district in Munich, is whether the public can address specific complaints relating to delays or corruption to the Council or the Association Council directly, and, if not, which body is responsible for accepting such complaints, which could subsequently be dealt with as part of the monitoring process?
costep_1997-11-20_7_20	Madam President, on 20 March in Brussels, I indicated on behalf of the Group Union for Europe that the particular features of the Lomé Convention were to be found largely in the contractual framework which it offers to the partnership and that this must be revitalized within the domain of political dialogue to ensure that our action is more effective. In addition, I pointed out that everyone agreed that this dialogue between the European Union and the ACP had failed, when the instruments are largely in place. In fact, I wanted to specify that for Europe the ACP group is not currently a real partner in the political dialogue, and that this dialogue lacks content and visibility. The open debate since the Green Paper shows that our cooperation with the ACP has lost legitimacy both within and outside the European Union, this cooperation is also no longer unique when commercial preferences are subjected to continuous erosion, and the debate also shows that the ACP is no longer pre-eminent in our actions. Faced with the growing concern of the ACP countries regarding the place we accord them in our policy of cooperation with less advanced countries, you will agree that this political coup de force on Togo is not likely to re-instil our partners' confidence, but will create a deep unease about the consideration we have for populations to which we owe a historical debt. The Group Union for Europe has always held that development aid is dependent on respect for human rights and democracy, but regrets that certain political groups demand that our Parliament questions the result of a vote to which we contributed. This draft resolution which has been submitted to us was rejected effectively by the Joint Assembly at Lomé on 30 October, in line with the internal ruling of the Joint Assembly, following a vote by separate college and secret ballot. To question this result in the absence of the ACP countries constitutes a violation of the internal ruling of the joint Assembly which we initiated, and stems from a lack of consideration for our ACP friends. We in the Group Union for Europe cannot sanction this in any way. Madam President, under these conditions my group will not support this behaviour and will make it known to all of our ACP partners.
costep_1997-12-18_5_53	Mr President, my comments concern the urgency resolution under consideration. I am always for economy measures, but when I tried to get hold of the text of the resolution, as usual, I was given the joint resolutions - but not the original texts. The reason given was that this was a cost saving measure. This simply cannot be true, since joint resolutions are often rejected in this House, to the effect that one then has to revert to the original texts. I would ask for clarification on this matter. Thanks to the efforts of Mrs Pack, for example, the absurd motion on Croatia is now somewhat less so, yet I would still have welcomed the opportunity to read the absurd texts in their original form. I earnestly request that something be done to remedy this situation.
costep_2003-09-02_2_11	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Pomés Ruiz for producing such a clear report. It highlights the need to take account of the territorial dimension of cohesion policy, over and above the purely economic and social aspects. This policy must be founded on the principle of solidarity, in order to reduce the disparities between regions, and to establish the principle of the equality of European citizens, regardless of where they live. Moreover, we should provide our fellow citizens with equal access to high-quality public services, which are the very social fabric of the regions of Europe. We should also recognise the special character, the quality of life and natural resources of the people of structurally disadvantaged regions, together with their heritage and their know-how. I agree with the rapporteur that it would be a mistake to concentrate all our financial support on the new Member States, and to neglect the currently eligible areas. We must remember that enlargement will increase regional disparities. I welcome the proposal to supplement Article 158 of the EC Treaty. This will mean that more account will be taken of the structural handicaps of islands, mountain regions and sparsely populated areas, in proportion to the severity of the difficulties experienced. These regions were sidelined under previous programmes. It is essential that they are now recognised in terms of accessibility, communication, infrastructure, financing and access to public services. This is vital if an exodus to the cities and the ageing of the population is to be prevented. The Endelave declaration was signed during a fact-finding visit made by the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities to this location, an island of 183 inhabitants in central Denmark. This declaration addresses the specific situation of small European islands, which can function perfectly well. It seeks to allow the people of these small islands to access good-quality services, such as ferries, doctors, veterinary surgeons, schools, ministers, home-helps and libraries, as long as financial support is provided in the spirit of solidarity. Lastly, in the name of the principle of subsidiarity, I feel I must highlight the importance of increasing the involvement of Member States and their decentralised authorities in cohesion policy. These bodies are closer to, and more aware of, the reality on the ground in their region.
costep_2001-11-12_9_7	Mr President, although in my view, national legislation is preferable to European legislation in most cases, this is different in this report. In the case of direct marketing by e-mail, this is clearly a matter with cross-border implications. I do not call for a complete ban on direct marketing by e-mail, but it is of the utmost importance for consumers to be given the choice beforehand whether they want to deal with this kind of direct marketing and for them to grant their approval or not, as the case may be. After all, that saves them a great deal of time, money and bother. Rapporteur Cappato suggests leaving the choice of opting in or out to the Member States. However, that would produce an incoherent European policy. A Member State that has chosen in favour of opting in will experience many difficulties in countering unwanted e-mails, if Member States that have chosen in favour of opting out do permit them. If European policy is divided and fragmented, the chances of establishing international agreements concerning unwanted e-mails are as good as non-existent. The problem is that businesses can easily side-step European rules from countries outside the European Union. This should not stop us from drafting legislation at European level. It is preferable to look for practical solutions to these problems and to work on international agreements. In that way, you and I will not be faced with e-mails from businesses which we do not need at all.
costep_2010-11-10_18_23	With the aim of meeting the EU 2020 strategy objectives, a sustainable, intelligent, inclusive economy is achieved through encouraging the field of research and innovation. Initiatives in this area must be forthcoming from every level, including as part of cross-border cooperation with other EU regions. I wish to stress the importance of a bottom-up approach in innovation. It is difficult to turn the innovative solutions produced by educational institutions or companies into a reality due to the lack of information or financial constraints. Regional authorities can raise the profile of these 'sleeping innovators', as they have been called, and support them using assistance and partnership programmes, with the help of the cohesion policy. Partnerships can be aimed at improving the performance of innovation, strengthening relations between initiators and beneficiaries, as well as at promoting good practice in this area. During the visit made by the Committee on Regional Development to Romania last week, we were presented with research and innovation projects devised by educational institutions in the Western Region, which I represent. The success of these initiatives is achieved precisely through establishing viable partnerships.
costep_2000-12-11_6_5	Madam President, our group supports Mr Trakatellis’s very well-produced report and also the work of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. We believe that, as Mr Trakatellis very effectively pointed out, we need to make arrangements in order to move ahead with the implementation of programmes in progress. Since all of Europe’s citizens are being affected by common problems relating to food, work, and various issues, it makes sense for there to be common European programmes which are becoming increasingly important in the joint combating, prevention, awareness and action in relation to these issues. It is therefore desirable that the efforts dedicated to these matters should increase. It is precisely on this issue that we believe there is a notable lack of direction in the European Union, in the Council and the Commission, which, with the budgetary cuts - not wanting to reach the ceiling of 1.27% which the regulations in force currently allow - is harming actions such as these at a time when coordination between the different Member States is becoming increasingly important. We also agree with the need stated in Mr Trakatellis’s report to balance the different programmes and actions which are underway. Furthermore, we must take account of the fact that prevention and promotion as well as monitoring are all going to be increasingly important and therefore they should be given more resources and a higher profile. Lastly, we believe that we should try to ensure that, in the future, situations such as this do not recur, with a lack of speed on the part of the Commission in providing for the renewal of all actions on time. This is a worrying state of affairs, which has caused concern amongst the many organisations involved and the problem should be resolved once and for all.
costep_1997-01-15_14_12	Mr President, there are a great many dimensions to improving air traffic flow in Europe. Air traffic causes problems, and noise nuisance and damage to the environment are among the greatest. These must be solved both at national level and through European cooperation. This is very important to us in Finland, as we are geographically in a very vulnerable position as air traffic congestion increases. On long journeys by air, delays recur and onward connections become more difficult. The integration work which Mr Cornelissen has called for to solve the problems with the aid of a European air traffic management system deserves support. The situation can be improved by adopting more direct routes and developing the civil aviation systems of Eastern European countries. From Finland’s point of view, greater involvement of the Baltic States, in particular, in European air traffic control cooperation is especially desirable. Consideration should also be given to what can be done to modernize the fleets of the former Soviet republics, in particular, and to improve air safety there; for example, pilots' proficiency in English, the international language of air traffic control, should be improved. A silent time-bomb is ticking away there, and the Union ought urgently to devote some of its resources to defusing it, in the manner of the TACIS and PHARE programmes. The situation should also be examined at national level. The benefits of coordination conferred by Eurocontrol and ATM, in whose work Finland also participates to some extent, are indisputable. However, they have not managed to harmonize their Member States' air traffic control systems or increase their safety. Finland is the only EU Member State which is still not a member of Eurocontrol. The reason lies in the fear that, inter alia, costs on internal routes might rise, military aviation might become subject to supervision, and it might become more difficult to subsidize little-used air-fields. Finland, the most northerly and easterly EU Member State, is rather large but sparsely populated, so that maintaining a dense and effective national air network is of vital importance to it. Despite centralization, the greatest responsibility lies with the individual Member States. Each country must itself shoulder its responsibility and invest, for example, the revenue from route levies so as to ensure that traffic flows smoothly within its own air space. The solution lies not only in the forum for European cooperation but close to those who suffer from the pollution and noise nuisance caused by congestion of air space.
costep_2010-05-05_22_10	Mr President, many times in this Chamber we have raised the matter of discrimination against the Polish minority in Lithuania, where the Poles who live there are not allowed to write their surnames using the original spelling, school classes which use Polish as the medium of instruction are being closed and land seized during the Soviet era is not being returned to its rightful owners just because they are Poles. Recently, the Chief Official Ethics Commission of Lithuania penalised Mr Tomaševski, leader of the Polish minority and a Member of the European Parliament, for putting a question - here, in this Chamber - to Mr Barroso about respect for the rights of minorities in Lithuania. These scandalous measures are intensifying. Several days ago, the Lithuanian Language Inspectorate imposed further high fines on the director of the Salcininkai local authority for using bilingual signs. Eighty per cent of the region’s population are Poles. Mr President, it is high time the European Parliament put an end to these scandalous actions of the Lithuanian Government. We take pride in the fact that human rights are the foundation of the Union. It is a poor foundation if we are unable to enforce these rights in Member States.
costep_2004-07-20_1_21	Mr President, having expressed our sincere gratitude to your predecessor, Mr Cox, we wish, in accordance with the forms and courtesies of this House, in turn to offer you our sincere congratulations on your election. These are, of course, congratulations that are offered not so much out of political considerations as to you, yourself, since, as has become apparent, this election is, as much as anything, fairly symbolic of the basic agreement that exists between the two main groups in this House, over and above the differences of opinion that, all in all, are relatively superficial. As a number of previous speakers have said, we hope you will defend the rights of all MEPs, including those who are at present in minorities and who, as has happened to certain other minorities in history, will perhaps be the majorities of tomorrow. They will include MEPs who, as they have every right to do, share their electorate’s unshakeable hostility towards the way in which our institutions are currently developing and who are resolved to defend the identity and fundamental freedoms of their respective nations. They will include MEPs whom, following the pattern in previous terms of office, hostile governments wish to strip of their mandates because of what they have said or because of their protests against the persecutions to which they are subject. They will include MEPs who do not belong to groups and who, although much larger in number than the members of certain groups and although representing no less than eight or ten nationalities, do not have a single interpreter, in French or English for example, at their work meetings - a form of discrimination that, during the previous Parliament, the Court of Justice had occasion to condemn in principle. In a word, we hope that you will be a President for all MEPs and ensure that the principle is respected whereby, in this Parliament, all MEPs are fully-fledged MEPs, whatever their opinions. The sitting was suspended at 12.30 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.
costep_2003-06-05_4_139	Breast cancer and cancer in general are a scourge which is not, in my opinion, inciting Europe and its Member States to take sufficient action in terms of research, prevention and quality of care, but also in terms of psychological monitoring of patients, who are often left alone to face this cruel illness. I therefore support everything that is done to remedy that situation, and I would like to highlight the funding that I succeeded in having adopted by the European Parliament and the Council when I drew up a report on the sixth framework programme for research and development. I therefore do of course support the excellent and relevant report by our colleague, Mrs Jöns, and her constant efforts in this respect.
costep_2000-07-05_8_3	Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal for a regulation on a Community patent gives us the chance to review cooperation, as you have just said, between the European Patent Office and the Community institutions. The patent recently issued to the University of Edinburgh poses the problem of the status of the EPO and how to control it. In the light of what has now been referred to as a mistake, it would appear that Directive 98/44 on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions is inaccurate and ambiguous, especially Articles 5(1) and 5(2). Should the Commission not propose a revision of this directive in order to preclude the possibility of patenting the discovery of a gene or genetic sequence? We must not skimp on this question, especially now that we are introducing a Community patent.
costep_2001-03-15_5_31	The Common Strategy of the European Union on Ukraine is merely a programme for accelerating the introduction of liberalism. Considerations about supporting the process of democratic transition do nothing to disguise the fact that the principal aim is to introduce a market economy and free trade. We are radically opposed to this way of thinking, which asks the Ukrainian authorities to give priority to encouraging 'private enterprise' and 'internal investments', to establishing in Ukraine, obviously with the help of European and international financial institutions, 'a foreign investments promotion agency', or to accelerating 'agricultural reform' and 'the transition to private ownership of the land' . As for those recitals which ask Ukraine to strengthen its system of border controls, so as to push out even further the barbed-wire fences of Fortress Europe, they can only aggravate the tragic refugee situation. This Common Strategy will bring with it only unemployment, social and economic catastrophe and poverty for the majority of the Ukrainian population, and will enable European investors to become even richer. That is why I voted against this report.
costep_2010-10-20_7_205	I voted in favour of this report, as there is a wide disparity in many countries as regards the payment terms to businesses when the state, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and large companies are involved. We are well aware that in the current economic crisis, and with its increased difficulties, companies are increasingly struggling with liquidity problems, and that in many Member States, they are even exposed to an increased risk of bankruptcy. The directive which attempted to regulate this matter had a limited effect, and the proposal that we have now adopted represents an important step in setting and meeting deadlines for payment, not only in relations between the companies and public bodies, but also in the relationships that companies establish with one another. We will now have legislation that offers us greater effectiveness in meeting payment deadlines, with a clear system of penalties for late payment, and that also represents an effective improvement in counteracting the frequent abuse by the state and large companies of their dominant position over the SMEs. This directive must now be implemented quickly by the Member States, so that the serious problems caused by the establishment of long payment terms and the dragging out of payments are finally resolved.
costep_2011-06-23_14_29	Madam President, I voted in favour of this initiative because Europe needs a strong common agricultural policy without cuts, a policy focused on promoting profitable farms and ensuring food security, sufficient supply and quality of production. Furthermore, agriculture needs support in order to innovate and focus effort on a more efficient use of energy, water and soil. All this must be combined with other forms of management that permit a fairer reward for the work carried out by professionals in this sector, a group of people who need to progress and continue learning throughout their working lives. These people need to be provided with simpler procedures, less bureaucracy and greater transparency in terms of objectives and tools. Accordingly, the new CAP must strengthen its commitment to active farmers, and to the contributions that they make in terms of production and a balanced development of rural areas. Moreover, profitability involves alignment of policies in this sector with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. For this reason, budgetary effort must also be maintained.
costep_2006-12-13_21_33	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the honourable Member alludes to the application of the general safeguard clause in Article 37 of the Act of Accession. The Council would like to draw the honourable Member’s attention to the answer which was given to her oral question H-0815 this year. She will certainly have realised that it is for the Commission, if requested with justification by a Member State, to decide on protection measures that it deems necessary in order to respond to a Member State’s request. Let me say here that last week an electric cable connection was established between Estonia and Finland, which will connect electricity networks in the Baltic and the Nordic Countries, and so also improve energy security in Lithuania. This will also be an important step forward in developing European networks.
costep_2010-04-19_23_7	Mr President, this own-initiative report concerns an extremely important area, because the role played by agriculture will only increase in the future. Demand for food is increasing rapidly worldwide at the same time as climate change is reducing the area of land available for farming across the globe. In addition, the demands of consumers regarding the quality of food are increasing. As well as reliably providing for its own food security, Europe must also play a role in maintaining the food supply in other continents. Investment in sustainable forestry and the better exploitation of forests must also be seen as an important part of EU climate policy. Because of this, I was also a little disappointed that in the EU’s 2020 strategy, a minuscule amount was invested in agriculture and forestry. After all, agriculture and forestry play a very vital role in ensuring the safety of European food, more effective bioenergy production and the viability of rural areas.
costep_2003-06-05_4_41	Mr President, I would like to come back to Mrs Malliori’s request. I spoke on this subject about a week ago, to be exact on the last day of the part-session. The problem is that the agenda is adopted on Monday, but not adhered to by Thursday. I believe it is inaccurate for Mrs Malliori to say that her report is being postponed until this afternoon. Today’s agenda states that the time allocated to all reports - from Mrs Jöns’s through to Mrs Fourtou’s - is 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m., which gives us until 4.30 p.m. to discuss this report. If it becomes the accepted thing to request that reports are dealt with without debate in order to be finished by 12 noon on Thursday, then people should say on Monday that a debate is not required when we are adopting the agenda. Last time, I said that this was a dangerous precedent, and indeed it is one. We have had two hours for the topical and urgent debate on the reform of the Rules of Procedure taken away from us for nothing, on the grounds that this time was needed for other work, and leaving us with just one hour. This time should then either be used or given back for the topical and urgent debate.
costep_2001-07-05_1_12	Madam President, in an article in an Italian newspaper today, President Prodi refers to the conclusions of the Gothenburg Summit on sustainable development as an example of directing globalisation towards objectives of world redistribution of wealth and protection of the environment. I will focus on this last aspect. It is true that Gothenburg incorporated the environmental dimension into the economic and social dimension. Protecting the environment is no longer merely a moral matter but an opportunity for a new wave of innovation that will generate growth and employment. The political importance is clear: this is a point of no return for the Member States but also for the candidate countries and third countries. Following the announcement that the United States wishes to oppose the Kyoto Protocol, this is a genuine declaration of intent with a view to the forthcoming international events: Genoa, of course, but then, more specifically, Bonn and, after that, Johannesburg in 2002. However, the point is this: even when they produce such major results, the great international summits do not succeed in communicating with what are known as the Seattle movements and, above all, do not connect with that much deeper, much more widespread, silent demand for security on the lips of the citizens, the submerged base of an iceberg whose tip is represented by the raft of different types of protests. Why? Why then is dialogue so difficult, not to say impossible? Of course, there is an element of parading before the media at these summits which is no longer tolerable. However, I also feel that confidence in the ability of politicians to implement these types of commitments has crumbled. There are many reasons why and we too bear some responsibility. Even at Gothenburg, when we needed to move on from words to action it was put off to a later date. There was no Sustainability Council, no time frame, no tangible reference to the implementation of environmentally friendly rules. When will these things happen?
costep_2005-04-28_1_116	The overview of human rights protection around the world portrayed in Mr Coveney’s report is, unfortunately, an accurate one. Looking at this report from our privileged situation, living in this part of the world, one inevitably feels a duty to take concerted and effective action to protect human rights (and to protect democracy, because, let us not forget, these two concepts are intrinsically linked; without democracy, there is no human rights protection). It is impossible to cover every aspect of such a broad issue, but there is one aspect that I wish to bring to the fore. I am concerned at the fact that it is not clear to many European politicians - albeit not only European politicians - that terrorism is the greatest threat to our societies and that it is a threat to our citizens (I shall not point out that they are innocent citizens, because that would suggest that there could be some sort of justification even if they were not innocent), to our societies, to the model that those societies represent and to democracy itself. Lastly, let this report send out a clear message that Europe will be resolute in promoting human rights and democracy.
costep_1997-06-25_8_20	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, basically what is known as the information society is the result of an objective process in the technology revolution which is unfolding, chiefly at the level of information and communication techniques. It is the result of the introduction of new technologies, services and innovations at an almost mind-blowing rate. It is undoubtedly the result of human achievement. Nevertheless, these achievements, having been pushed on by selfish interests and by the engine of commerce, have been appropriated by those doing the pushing and their use is very far from intended to benefit all humanity. Quite the reverse! We are very concerned at the role which this process might play in accentuating - even exacerbating - yawning social chasms which are already so marked and so serious. In fact, it seems clear to us, that with the way it is being built, the information society is exacerbating and accentuating these chasms by creating a divide between those with access and those who are far from having access or who are excluded. The amendments we support to the Boogerd-Quaak report are designed to reflect that concern and, if they are adopted, we shall vote in favour of the report as we shall for the Hendrick, Rübig and Ahlqvist reports and we congratulate all the rapporteurs on the work they have done. Finally, I cannot, nor do I wish to remain silent about the threat that we shall have to contend with different types of illiteracy under the umbrella of the information society as it is being built: the illiteracy of those who do not learn to either read, write or count and who are thus forced to live as though in the last century or even several centuries ago and who will constitute a significant part within the large and growing number of social strata cut off from the new technologies; -the illiteracy of those who rapidly forget how to read, write and count because all they can do is click an electronic mouse, brilliantly of course, and who will live in a world of the future which I want, although I fight against it in that form, since it will create an ever-broader social spread with infra-humans on the one extreme and information supermen on the other who have no idea about Rimbaud and who are indifferent to the horrors of economics.
costep_1998-02-20_4_12	Mr President, I too would like to compliment the speaker, Mr Wynn, and the Committee on Budgetary Control for their work on this subject and for their proposal, which I believe should be approved, to refuse to give Parliament’s opinion on the proposed financial regulations for the Eighth European Development Fund. I firmly believe in cooperating towards the development of the EU and, for me, this is a positive and useful provocation and an act of political and institutional responsibility on the part of the European Parliament. We are now in an inexplicable situation in the sense that it is difficult to explain it abroad, and substantially untenable, from both a logical and a political point of view. This obviously relates to the characteristics of the EDF and the fact that it is not included in the budget. I would like to remind you that, with regard to cooperation in development, the EDF’s inclusion in the budget was almost the only request made by the European Parliament to the Intergovernmental Conference, but was hardly mentioned. This highlights the fact that Parliament’s consultation is purely optional on many measures and that, on implementing measures and even on negotiations on the Lomé Conventions, its prerogatives are simply shown to be a power of political influence - being able to give its opinion which, however, is never binding. Consequently, in many cases, Parliament does not have any influence on the definition of significant aspects of the Convention itself and subsequently, above all, on its management. By way of example, the proposed regulation on which we will not be giving an opinion does not provide for any Parliamentary role, even in the procedure for justifying the budget, even when this concerns the resources of the EDF managed by the European Investment Bank, which comprise an ever greater part of the EDF itself. Who is asking Parliament not to give this opinion today? Obviously, those more concerned with the outcome of the cooperation policies and the institutional and managerial correctness of the measures taken by the Community institutions. Rather than legal, the problem is therefore a political one. Our opinion is therefore all the more important as we are dealing with the debate on what to do after the year 2000 - that is, after the Fourth Lomé Convention. We obviously have a problem, and despite the fact that the Lomé Convention has been and continues to be a unique means of exceptional importance today, the fact that Parliament has been unable to exercise its role on control and on the definition of managerial means to the full is obviously a problem, and has certainly limited its scope and impact.
costep_1998-10-20_7_15	Mr President, I should like to examine certain aspects which, in truth, represent only a tiny percentage of the budget but are of major relevance to Parliament and its relations with the European citizens. I refer to the education and culture programmes. This year the budget discussions have been especially tough in this field, and my colleagues and I are very satisfied with the agreement reached on the legal bases. Although this agreement is positive in respect of interinstitutional relations and at last clarifies thelegal options and creates transparency in the budget, it has placed the rapporteur in a considerable dilemma. The rapporteur has done a tremendous job concerning the sum earmarked for pilot schemes and preparatory actions, managing to take on board the demands of all the committees and of Parliament as a whole, as well as - most importantly - those of the citizens. The so-called 'other social operations' are always something of a Cinderella in the budget, even though they are a means of enabling citizens to identify with Europe and to expect that their problems will be addressed. The work of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Budgets Committee pre-empted the Amsterdam Treaty, in a sense. I really would have expected the Council to be equally bold at its first reading. Although it was not, we were. I hope that, at second reading, the Council will not assess Parliament’s decisions in its traditional manner, but will comply with the undertakings it made when drawing up the agreement on the legal bases. In particular, I think that it is important to satisfy the voluntary sector, which has been seeking in recent years to confront problems that cannot be solved by either the Community budget - not being competent to do so - or the Member States. I should like to draw attention to one final aspect: training. As the rapporteur said this morning, education and training shape the future of our young people, enabling them to find their way in this frontier-free Europe and look forward to a brighter future. Finally, I should like to thank the rapporteur once again for having done whatever could be done, and indeed more - within such tight budgetary constraints - to satisfy all concerned.
costep_2008-06-05_2_36	I welcome the establishment of the Union for the Mediterranean, which will help to improve and intensify relations with our Mediterranean partners and will promote mutual awareness, growth, employment and training in the EU and the 12 non-European countries concerned. Promoting peace and democracy, immigration controls, economic relations and raw materials supplies: these have historically been the key points of my country’s neighbourhood policy with the Mediterranean countries. Bettino Craxi was a pioneer in this regard. The Union for the Mediterranean will help to facilitate the completion of cross-border projects that are important for the entire area, serving to improve the motorways of the seas, combat marine pollution, improve civil protection, create a better-integrated energy market and develop new renewable technologies. The Union for the Mediterranean must contribute to promoting democracy and resolving the conflicts that are still destabilising the Middle East and the Western Sahara, with assistance from the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly, which must be fully involved.
costep_2011-04-06_9_399	Fraud, according to the rapporteur’s very apt definition, 'is an example of purposeful wrongdoing and is a criminal offence', and an irregularity 'is a failure to comply with a rule'. This is the defining framework under which we should have zero tolerance for fraud and make it our goal, as he said with regard to the 2008 report, to achieve zero financial irregularities in the EU. As I pointed out in a question at the end of last year, following an investigation by the Financial Times, there are serious doubts as to the aim and effectiveness of the Cohesion Fund. These doubts cannot simply remain confined to the newspapers. At the same time, this report too 'deplores the fact that large amounts of EU funds are still wrongly spent and calls on the Commission to take appropriate action with a view to ensuring prompt recovery of those funds'. This misuse of EU funds makes better administration necessary, as well as monitoring of how funds are spent. There must also be provision for effectively penalising Member States that do not make good use of the funds that they have received. That is the only way that we can move towards the target of zero fraud in the EU.
costep_2009-11-25_8_22	Mr President, the debate on origin marking absolutely does not prioritise the interests of one or a few Member States, as is sometimes mistakenly believed. Instead, it embodies the fundamental economic principle of levelling the playing field. This principle, in line with the Treaty of Lisbon, aims to implement European competitiveness at international level by promoting clear and balanced rules for our producing companies and companies that import products from third countries. We are therefore discussing matters that concern Europe as a whole. For this reason, I believe it is essential to reach an agreement on origin marking that goes beyond individual national interests or those of political groups and leaves room for the will to implement a single market by promoting competitiveness and transparency. Submitting to Parliament the proposal for a regulation on origin marking, as it was formulated by the European Commission in 2005, represents a step forward in this regard. In line with the Treaty of Lisbon, the process of codecision between Parliament and the Council will therefore make it absolutely possible to speed up the approval of a regulation that is so important to the economy and European consumers. Written explanations of vote
costep_2010-05-05_14_181	I believe that progress has been made on animal welfare through the implementation of the Action Plan 2006-2010, as the majority of measures featuring in this plan have been implemented in a satisfactory manner. As a member of the committee which monitors public health and food safety, I particularly welcomed the measures taken to reduce the harmful effects which the use of antibiotics in animal nutrition has on human health, following the ban on them in 2006. These are further reasons why I voted for this report. However, I wish to emphasise that the future action plan should include more measures aimed at supporting EU farmers and at improving the enforcement of current regulations on animal transport in Member States.
costep_2001-03-14_3_38	Mr President, I am prompted to say 'How cold it is!' This is the second report in which we take an interest in warming up people in our Community. Earlier on, we were thinking about warming up the drivers of articulated lorries, and now we have this report - I voted for it - which seeks to improve energy efficiency in the European Community. It also covers all forms of energy saving such as district heating in cities - something I hope for warmly, the right word in the circumstances. In fact, a lot of energy can be saved with district heating, because a single boiler can heat the homes of ten, twenty, a hundred, a thousand city dwellers. So, with this system, there could also be more heating in the houses of pensioners, who are often cold because of their modest pensions.
costep_2003-06-18_3_149	Mr President, very little is as yet known about the submarine environment. That is why, moreover, it is hard to organise any sort of viable programme of protection. Stocks of some monitored, familiar species, that is to say mainly economically important species, have in many places diminished drastically. How can we protect species, therefore, about which we still do not even know anything? Protection is nevertheless the starting point for the EU marine strategy. Consequently, I too have proposed that we should grant sufficient appropriations to enable us to carry out an investigation and draw up an inventory of submarine species. The Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission, HELCOM, has made more than 200 recommendations for improving the state of the Baltic. These are not binding on the Member States but the Commission might examine them and propose rules based on them that are. In the same way, EU investment is needed for the protection of nature in the northern seas. This would come about most effectively if the EU joined the Nordic countries, the United States of America, Canada and Russia as members of the Arctic Council. That would promote shared Euro-Atlantic understanding of environmental problems. There are environments in the European Union, such as many areas of the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, where the natural environment would not necessarily recover properly from a large-scale oil disaster. That is why we must have more talks with countries such as Russia to develop stricter common standards for merchant vessels. It is vital that oil tankers sailing in the sort of difficult icy conditions there were last winter are immune to risk. The Commission should propose an amendment, within the framework of UNCLOS, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which would allow intervention with regard to merchant vessels from third countries sailing through or close to EU waters if they are thought to be a potentially serious threat. In addition to oil disasters we should also consider, for example, the loud noise made by equipment used in mapping the location of natural resources to be a pollutant. I would furthermore like to draw the attention of the Commission, and the Council too for that matter, to the Member States' unsatisfactory capacity for tackling oil spills. I myself looked into the situation recently when I sent out questionnaires to those authorities in the Baltic countries responsible for this matter. The replies made disappointing reading. The situation was best in Finland and Sweden, where the equipment they have would be sufficient in practice for clearing the oil coming from a broken fuel tank on a large passenger ship. If there were a major disaster the equipment in these countries would be insufficient even if it were used in combination. Around 40 million tonnes of oil a year already pass through the Gulf of Finland, for example, and it is supposed that this volume will have doubled in 10 year’s time. The Commission should initiate a survey of capacity for tackling oil spills and adopt rules for sufficient minimum capacity based on regional conditions and volumes of traffic.
costep_2000-11-30_2_64	I voted in favour of this measure, Madam President, because it is only right that any attempt to bring peace to regions where internecine strife and civil conflicts rage should be supported by the Pensioners' Party. I must, however, make one point to Mrs Theorin: among the numerous proposals she presented for women to be able to influence peace in war zones, she forgot to propose that the top echelons of armies should also be filled with women. Madam President, if you are clever and capable enough to direct this quarrelsome European Parliament, you would surely also be able to direct the military forces deployed to bring peace to war zones: you could thus make your contribution in support of women’s beneficial influence on peace.
costep_2011-06-08_3_8	Mr President, my group would like to see European financing that reflects Europe’s new realities, trends and aims. Do the state of the public finances of our Member States, our growth prospects and Europe’s place in the world match the vision of the founding fathers of Europe? Definitely not: they have evolved and changed. It would be irresponsible if we failed to adjust how Europe is financed to reflect these changes. The Multiannual Financial Framework is a highly political issue that the special committee, working with the Committee on Budgets, has been discussing for over a year. I would like to congratulate the committee on its work. I hope that the European spirit found in the committee will shape the implementation of the framework and take Europe forward for the benefit of our citizens. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) calls on all Member States to participate fully in this debate. When I say fully, I mean not simply announcing that the ultimate aim is to freeze European expenditure to 2020, nor dismissing out of hand the notion of European own resources. We want own resources in order to reduce pressure on national budgets. This is why we are proposing the concept of own resources to the Heads of State or Government: to ease straitened national budgets. Let me remind you that the European budget has always been balanced, unlike national budgets, which, for the most part, have serious deficits. Let me also remind you that over 90% of that budget is spent on projects that benefit Member States. Lastly, let me remind the Member States that any money which is not spent will be returned to them at the end of the year. Yet we are accused of being poor managers: I think that we need to ramp up our communication efforts. So please, let us stop treating the European budget as a strain on domestic finances. Let us be honest: one euro spent at European level brings far greater returns than a euro spent by national governments. Between 20 and 30 cents of one euro of national spending are immediately diverted to repay interest on the national debt. Europeans need to be told the truth. The truth is that without European funding for education and lifelong learning, the brain drain to China and the United States will gain momentum. The truth is that without European funding for research and innovation, our countries would be less competitive globally, while growth and employment would languish. The truth is that without European cohesion funding, the gap between rich and poor regions would widen. The truth is that without European funding, food security policy, energy policy and climate change policy would be unable to match our expectations and aims. Ladies and gentlemen, the truth is that without European funding for foreign and defence policies, the European Union would have remained in the wings instead of at the centre of the world stage. Of course, money is not the only consideration: how the European Union chooses to invest and to implement political priorities to 2020 and beyond will determine Europe’s capacity for influencing the world. The European Parliament - and for once, the groups that have already spoken are in agreement with me - is therefore calling on the Council to give serious thought to its position on the financial framework. If the Council is seriously committed to seeing growth and employment pick up, then it needs to use the European budget and Community own resources as a powerful lever. If, like Parliament and the Commission, the Council really wants to give Europe a real chance in the context of globalisation, then it needs to understand that spending wisely is far more useful than limiting spending and that joint funding for joint projects is a more intelligent approach than spreading resources thinly between short-lived projects. Ladies and gentlemen, this morning, the members of the PPE Group are calling for an ambitious view of Europe. Our fellow citizens share our ambition and hopes. As young people express their anxieties on the streets of Athens and Madrid, as 500 million Europeans are wondering what their future holds, it is time to ask the right questions and to come up with responses to the issues that we face.
costep_1998-06-16_13_11	Mr President, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the idea that increasing the use of renewable energy sources is also a security policy. EU dependence on imported energy is growing. In twenty years time 94 % of our oil, 80 % of our coal and 75 % of our natural gas will be imported from parts of the world which are very often unstable. This also speaks in favour of the increased use of renewable energy resources. We see, however, a conflict between worthy aims and insufficient means. It is quite clear that at the present rate the 15 % share for renewable energy is not going to be achieved, and it will not be possible either to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 % by the year 2012. There is a particularly clear contradiction, as has been said here, between the White Paper and Agenda 2000. That is that the increased use of biomasses is, above all else, a matter of agricultural policy and not energy policy. I myself would prefer to have the heat from the sun and the heat from the earth.
costep_2001-01-16_12_15	Mr President, Commissioner, I trust that we have not bitten off more than we can chew this late in the day because this first fisheries debate of 2001 really is a far-reaching debate. It gives me special pleasure, Commissioner Fischler, to be able to welcome you here today. For a long time, fisheries debates were held in Strasbourg on Fridays. This year we have done away with Fridays and brought the debate forward to Tuesday, and while many Members are still not listening to us today, you at least are here and I thank you for that. The new year is a time of hope and expectation, especially for our fishermen. I need only mention the reform of the common fisheries policy and the Commission’s eagerly awaited Green Paper. However, I am forced to admit that the worry lines on my fellow Members' brows and - as far as I can see from here, on your brow, too, Mr Fischler - are still as deep as ever. One reason must surely be the continuing and difficult negotiations on the fisheries agreement with Morocco. I am afraid that there is still no light at the end of that particular tunnel. The Commission’s cautious and diplomatic approach - if I may express it thus - be it on your part, Mr Fischler, or on the part of Commission President Prodi, has met with little response and hence no real progress on the other side - I am tempted to say the opposing side. I think that is a crying shame because I want an agreement although, let there be no mistake, I do not want an agreement at any price. The financial framework is limited and EU payments must be in proportion to the benefits granted in return. In the final analysis, the Kingdom of Morocco needs to take a realistic and trustworthy approach. Otherwise, Morocco’s obstructionist stance hitherto may well come back to haunt it, because fisheries are not the only link between Morocco and the EU. The EU should not be the bull in diplomacy’s china shop, but nor should it merely be an irritating fly buzzing around. The next round of financial compensation for Spanish and Portuguese fishermen is coming up. It really is time we started thinking about and naming alternatives, however drastic they may be, because aid cannot and should not be a permanent solution. We are looking forward, at last, to taking a closer look at the study on the cost-benefit analysis of the fisheries agreement and drawing the necessary conclusions. Mr Gallagher addresses this particular point in his report. We had an initial presentation an awfully long time ago and after that mum was the word. But we must watch out - it could be the calm before the storm, because there is every sign of a storm brewing. But first I should like to thank Pat Gallagher for his excellent report. As one of our most active comrades-in arms in the Committee on Fisheries, he has yet again done a creditable job. There really is no longer any need to make a point of stressing just how important an analysis of measures and developments is, especially in view of the reform of the entire fisheries policy. But just what will the Commission’s long-awaited Green Paper propose? The objective - on this we are clear - must be to reconcile the need to improve fish stocks with the social and economic importance of fisheries, in which case it is vital for interest groups to be more involved and, given the considerable shortcomings now coming to light in the agricultural sector alone, for example as the result of BSE, it also means finding a new, attractive way of marketing fish as a healthy, protein-rich food. As I am sure you are all aware, a huge programme of work awaits us. I am looking forward to a stimulating and controversial debate in the interest of the future of European fisheries. In any case, I think we should not slacken in our efforts.
costep_2001-05-16_14_3	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her hard work on behalf of the members in the run up to the preparation of Parliament’s budget. Nonetheless, I should like to take this opportunity to pick out one or two points and examine them more closely. Enlargement: of course we must prepare for enlargement. But anyone who thinks that preparing for enlargement merely means creating new posts has failed to recognise the problem. Everything has to be tested against what we have learned to appreciate and love about the modus operandi of the European Parliament over the last twenty years. We face a huge challenge if we want to master all that. Nor is it a question of creating new posts and manning them with officials from applicant countries. Why are there no other options in situ? For example, the Commission intends to work with satellites in applicant countries in the translation area. We need to create information offices because we have a problem as regards the acceptance of accession to the European Union. That is our job as representatives of the people. It is not a question of taking a few people to the fleshpots of Europe here in Strasbourg or in Brussels or Luxembourg, it is a question of bringing people to the European Union. That is best done locally. That is why I ask you to consider carefully what really needs to be done and what is better done through activities in the candidate countries, in order to save money. The Commission is on the right track here. Buildings policy: I agree with the rapporteur that, as things stand, the cheapest solution here in Strasbourg is to pay off the outstanding amounts as quickly as possible. But that is only the second cheapest solution. We must be clear about that. The cheapest solution would be to build ourselves. Then we can decide on the layout and fittings, without having to admit in the end that someone has done well out of us and that now we must somehow take over. We went through that in Brussels and we have been through it here. We could show a bit more intelligence here. That would be the cheapest solution. What we are doing is the second cheapest and I should like to make that clear. Staff policy: I am surprised at the administration, which is calling for numerous new posts on the one hand, while at the same time making increasing concessions in the so-called non-occupancy quota. This means that more posts are saved than new posts requested. We still need an in-depth discussion of how this can be reconciled. In other words, there is a great deal of room for manoeuvre by transferring staff between the services of the European Parliament without always needing to create new posts straight away. I can tell you now that the PPE group will be looking at this issue very closely in the autumn, once we have the actual figures to work with. I am delighted that the rapporteur has also taken up our transport options. I hope that we shall not have to cycle around Brussels. I consider that far too dangerous. I think the initiative by the town of Strasbourg following the change in the mayor’s office is real progress. We too can take the tram now. Perhaps we can take the metro in Brussels. That would take us one stage further. But, as I say, bicycles in general are too dangerous in my book. I hope that we can find a reasonable solution here. We in the PPE shall carry out a strict and close examination of the budget line by line in the autumn, once the figures are available. But let me make one thing clear: if the report is adopted tomorrow, this does not mean free passage for the reading which we shall have to hold in September or October.
costep_2003-02-11_2_102	Mr President, just after seeing the Italian theatrical character, Pantalone, who advised me how to vote on the Santini report, I saw a Mafioso. A member of the Mafia came up to me, sniggering, and said: 'Ha ha! Now you are discussing the Hernández Mollar report which seeks to prevent us Mafiosi from moving freely throughout Europe. I have to tell you, Mr Fatuzzo, that I like listening to your explanations of vote. Even if you stop the citizens of any third State from moving within Europe without a visa, we Mafiosi are so clever that we will succeed in entering countries and commiting crimes just the same. Therefore, would it not be better to give everybody free movement without visas and deal with us separately, if you do not want us, to stop us getting in and causing damage?'
costep_1998-03-11_3_11	Mr President, with regard to the Kosovo crisis, European diplomacy must demonstrate that it is capable of acting with as much pertinence and efficiency as it did in the Iraqi crisis. It is a crisis which could degenerate dangerously, but which can still probably be controlled if European diplomacy is able to show the same judgement and determination that has been shown by the precise actions of France and Germany. It must show its ability to take all the factors into consideration, in particular the fact that Kosovo is the Serbs' Paris and yet is today populated by up to 90 % Albanians. It must bear in mind that the disintegration of Yugoslavia began with questions regarding the wide autonomy which Kosovo enjoyed within the former federation. Since then, the conflict has continued to brew. Today, the corresponding hardening of attitude of both the Albanian separatists and the Serb authorities is moving the crisis into a new and extremely worrying dimension, with an increase in tension. The international community must therefore intensify its activity, even if it does not have the same basis on which to act as in Bosnia, whose independence it recognized. But in the case of a stepping up in the conflict, the risks of globalization are such that the Kosovo issue can no longer be considered a purely internal issue. This is especially true with regard to Macedonia where a quarter of the population is Albanian and particularly since Albania is becoming increasingly nervous. Even if the most adequate way of expressing the international community’s will is currently through the six countries of the contact group - since it is essential that we stick together - the action of European diplomacy within this body must be decisive in order to avoid the sudden turnarounds on the part of some of its members or the refusal of any globalization on the part of others. It is fortunate that yesterday’s meeting of the contact group in London echoed the call for a negotiated solution already heralded by Paris and Bonn. This should lead to a special intermediary status somewhere between that of independence and the current situation, neither of which are adequate options. It is also a question of finding the means for effective pressure, to the right extent, to convince both sides not to feed the intensification of the conflict. It is therefore essential, Mr President, to step up the measures concerning positive incentives, considering in particular the different ways of reintegrating Belgrade into the international community. This is the path that was upheld in London under the influence of the Europeans, who must retain this leadership. It is the right path. It must be followed with consistency and determination.
costep_2010-02-24_13_50	Madam President, President in Office of the Council, I am pleased that you are here with us. I do not understand why the Council is attempting to make a decision in such haste, without any serious consultation with the European Parliament. We need the 2020 strategy as the Lisbon Strategy has not proved to be effective. However, the documents which are going round are general and fail to provide any clear statements referring to the future challenges. One example is the social aspect. The main social problems in Europe are the increased ageing of the population and the lack of high qualifications for workers. In these circumstances, allocating less than 2% of GDP to research, development and innovation is a first mistake which needs to be quickly rectified. Research and development could be based on public-private partnerships and on encouraging business people to invest in research laboratories and institutes in order to discourage the brain drain to the United States or Japan.
costep_2010-10-21_8_50	The financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries and territories is a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories. It aims to support economic, financial and technical cooperation, as well as academic and research exchanges. The aim of this regulation is to broaden the scope of this instrument substantially to include cooperation with developing countries, for which the overall financial framework should be increased. The geographical expansion proposed here is an opportunity to take the programmes to new countries and is also a major challenge, meaning that it is important to make it very clear to whom this financing can be given, for what and under what conditions.
costep_2010-03-11_3_8	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several European regions have been hit by some exceptional natural meteorological phenomena, which have resulted in huge material, economic, agricultural and environmental damage, and have sadly claimed too many human lives. I dare to hope, Commissioner, that beyond your due condolences, the European Solidarity Fund, a European activity that in this case is useful, will be able to be implemented quickly and flexibly in both France and Madeira, just as it has been - as someone said - in other European countries, to help my compatriots in Vendée and Charente-Maritime restore their vital infrastructure and services. It is my understanding from what you have said that the French Government has not yet referred this matter to you, and I am very surprised at that. However, I must say that there are some aspects to the way in which certain people are exploiting these events that I find quite intolerable. Firstly, this compulsive need to link the natural disasters that we are suffering to socalled global warming. No matter what political or pseudo-scientific claims we may be fed, they will not dictate the weather and the tides any more than they will prevent earthquakes. The second is the systematic search for culprits and easy scapegoats. The Xynthia disaster in the west of France is due to the very rare combination of two events: the storm itself, of course, and some unusually high tides, which led to the collapse of the dams. Controversy has erupted over the building permits granted by the mayors, who have been made personally responsible for the deaths that have occurred in their municipalities. However, no one - not the département, the region, the public services, the town planners or the architects - objected to these building permits requested by individuals. The elected representatives of the region, and in particular in the small municipalities, are quite rightly held in high regard by their fellow citizens. They shoulder a great deal of responsibility for virtually nothing, they have a remarkable sense of the general interest, they are coping with ever more complex duties, for which Europe is partly responsible, and they have also been completely abandoned by the public authorities, and I was anxious to point this out here.
costep_1998-11-17_3_11	Mr President, the European Court of Auditors points out that in terms of external actions, the European Union has become one of the largest donors in the world with a total of ECU 6 billion, or almost FRF 40 billion. But your report, Mr Friedman, highlights serious shortcomings, particularly in public procurement procedures, the quality of contractors and, finally, the follow-up procedures for the actions. This being the case, do you not think that there is a serious risk, particularly in certain countries such as those of the former Soviet Union, that Community aid, rather than helping the people, only in fact serves to increase corruption and the power of the mafias? Would it not therefore be wise to reduce this type of aid, which can do more harm than good, and wait for proper control procedures that guarantee that Community aid is used effectively and honestly?
costep_2002-10-22_2_95	Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets and the Commissioner. As we have already stated, the Group of the Liberal Democrat and Reform Party is fairly satisfied with this budget, which would appear to be rigorous and transparent throughout. This is part of our tradition. I would, however, immediately add that, in my view, it is also an excessively technical budget with only a very limited political dimension. We can accept the basic lines, particularly those relating to reform and enlargement, of course, which I feel is the greatest challenge facing us. However, precisely because it is a challenge, we must take more decisive, political action, action which is, above all, more visible to all the European citizens. I too, like the Committee Chairman, who spoke just now, feel that it is imperative that the procedure is reformed. The technical elements of the procedure need to be revised, it needs to be simplified and, in particular, its cultural and political dimensions need to be developed, with the Council’s powers defined in such a way that they are maximised, not reduced, to achieve a more effective, more focused and, above all, more topical debate. There needs to be a basic philosophy underlying the European budget, a basic philosophy of shared, not concentrated, administrative responsibility - and I stress, shared: this is extremely important - and Parliament needs to have a greater political role, for it must discharge its mandate as effectively as possible. Parliament, like the Union as a whole, must be a visibly political institution and make political responses. I will focus on just two technical aspects. The first concerns the issue of category 4, which my colleague has already touched on. I would add something further. It may be that we pay little or rather too little attention to the Mediterranean question, it may be that we pay too little attention to the issue of the Middle East. We go so far as to debate reconstruction, Afghanistan and issues concerning very distant countries, but there is a matter nearer to home which we will soon, all too soon, have to address more thoroughly and much more decisively. I will mention one more issue: culture. The funds committed for young people, training and information are utterly inadequate.
costep_2011-02-16_7_132	I voted in favour of this draft motion for a resolution, because small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make a fundamental contribution to economic growth, social cohesion, job creation and innovation. It is very important to establish effective instruments to support SME finance, paying particular attention to mezzanine financial instruments in the next programming period, which would remove obstacles to financing and would promote the creation and growth of new innovative enterprises, providing greater access to European venture capital and bond markets, while at the same time removing the barriers to the development of these markets. I agree with the proposal aiming to create better conditions for start-ups and innovative enterprises to have access to private equity. We must make every effort to ensure that existing financing facilities are effectively implemented both at national and EU levels, simplifying administrative procedures and making it easier to use the Structural Funds. It is very important for the Member States to implement fundamental reforms in SME taxation and support systems. There also needs to be increased funding from the EU budget for innovative financial instruments, with more funding being allocated to the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme. Furthermore, administrative obstacles must be reduced for SMEs, streamlining management in connection with innovative financial instruments, coordinating SME financing programmes and creating a one-stop shop.
costep_2010-11-25_9_195	Although Europe leads the field in alternative energy generation, we are still overly dependent on fossil fuels, especially oil. This dependency has international ramifications, as most sources of fossil fuel are found outside the EU. The Treaty of Lisbon has established new energy competences for the European Union, an extremely important area of competence. In response, Parliament has adopted an energy strategy for 2011-2020, which I have supported. The strategy involves encouraging investment in this field and promoting initiatives focused on renewable energies. The aim is, of course, to guarantee security of supply in the EU, which is why managing the gas and oil pipelines that currently supply the Union is considered a top priority. The strategy therefore combines short-term energy security needs and plans to provide for future European energy requirements.
costep_2005-02-22_1_140	Mr President, Commissioner, Natura 2000 is one of the major issues that often allow doubts to persist about European construction. Our fellow citizens share our ambition of protecting biodiversity and see that we are producing texts, but when it comes to obtaining funds, Europe does not deliver the goods. Our fellow citizens accept the idea of sustainable development, thinking that it is possible to reconcile protecting the earth with economic development and employment, but when they need the channels and resources to do this, Europe does not deliver the goods. We therefore need to find some new instruments for maintaining Natura 2000. I would like to make three demands: first of all, we need a specific fund, because objectively there is a contradiction between expectations for funds to promote economic development, rural development, and sustaining the land in accordance with Natura 2000. We therefore need a specific fund, which is the first demand. My second demand: the implementation of Natura 2000 needs to be favoured in the criteria for all European funds. I will give you an example to illustrate the contradiction. In the current ERDF regulation that you are in the process of negotiating, the areas are limited to wooded or cultivated areas. Natura 2000 needs natural, untouched land that is not wooded or cultivated, in other words wetlands. Thirdly, we need an instrument for innovation, so that practices on the ground are more in line with what we could provide for in the future. Therefore in Life + we need a specific instrument and we need to maintain two pillars: a general environmental pillar and a pillar for Life Nature, as we had before. As you have understood, Commissioner, as they stand, we do not think that the Commission’s proposals will convince our fellow citizens on the ground. We believe that protecting biodiversity is a step forward, which is compatible with the development of rural areas and the economic future of our country. We therefore now need proof of this conviction, in the form of three billion euros at least from the Structural Funds.
costep_1998-06-15_5_11	Mr President, after years of lip service about compliance with human rights in the ACP countries, Mrs Aelvoet has managed to find a method whereby we have come a step closer to the effective functioning of the European institutions with regard to human rights compliance. Moreover, the role of this Parliament has been strengthened. I agree with Mr Bertens: it is not good enough yet, but it is a start. Bravo, Mrs Aelvoet! But how can this proposal be successful if an important country like Angola continues to arm itself heavily? Angola has sold its oil supply for the coming three years, and with this money it has paid for the weapons in cash, weapons from Brazil and Russia - Russia, a member of the troika which has to supervise the peace process, would you believe? The fact that Angola, a one-party state, can take this decision without democratic consultation with the legal opposition represents a failure of the democratic Lomé test. So I urge the Council and the Commission to come up with a concrete proposal and an interim report from the European Parliament for the ACP counties to adhere to the arms percentage laid down in the Treaty. Obviously, they should also adhere to the good governance referred to by Mrs Günther. Only then will democracy and human rights have a chance in the ACP countries as well.
costep_2010-03-11_2_40	The fact that we are having a debate today in the European Parliament about investments in low-carbon technology highlights that the European Union wishes to confirm its leading role not only in reducing energy consumption and making it more efficient, but also in ensuring a healthy environment. I believe that our role now is to promote areas such as research and innovation, in order to identify solutions which will provide the foundations for a sustainable European energy system. We must therefore establish the funding requirements in this area, with the aim of increasing the European Union’s competitiveness globally. I think that it is vital for us to focus attention on the specific potential of green energy at regional and local level. The region I come from in Romania offers significant potential for geothermal energy, which is not being utilised sufficiently at the moment. There are various reasons for this, but I think that we must give local authorities an important role in this to encourage them to develop public-private partnerships. Thank you.
costep_2005-04-28_1_31	Mr President, I too should like to add my thanks to the rapporteur for her commitment. Good though it was that she should be so committed from the start, the report now produced by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety appears to tend towards tightening up the Commission’s original proposal; Amendments 43, 103 and 94 to it certainly do. I wonder how Parliament intends to deal with those. Acceptance of those amendments will once again result in an increase in the burden and cost, particularly for European agriculture and horticulture - two areas that are self-evidently bound to benefit from clean water. Although the proposal, fortunately, also leaves sufficient room for subsidiarity, it cannot be denied that when the budget for European agricultural policy is reduced and the markets become more deregulated, it will drive up still more the cost price for European agriculture and horticulture. It is unacceptable that this House should on the one hand increase the burden and on the other hand deregulate the markets even further, it thereby puts the European countryside in an impossible position. I would like to urge this House in any event not to make the Commission proposal any more stringent, and certainly to vote against Amendments 43 and 94. I should also like to back Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s Amendment 110, which would make the groundwater directive considerably more workable with regard to river policy in Europe. Applause
costep_2010-02-25_4_39	Mr President, I, too, would like to take this opportunity to emphasise the points that some of us believe should be fundamental in the final report on which we are going to vote. These points include: the precautionary principle, which is fundamental and essential; reducing capacity, which is absolutely urgent; limiting the public subsidy policy; and improving controls and prosecuting, relentlessly and with a clear conscience, crimes committed by those who do things the wrong way and encourage others to do the same. However, we also need to promote sustainable gear and sustainable fishing, which means that we have to make progress on the definition of small-scale fishing, which is something that undoubtedly needs greater clarification. I want to mention, too, the role of women and the recognition that their work deserves, an aspect on which we have also tabled amendments. Finally, I believe that it is important to stress and call for greater coherence and responsibility in the fisheries agreements with third countries; the agreements with Morocco and Guinea, for example, demand this.
costep_2009-03-24_10_15	The report makes certain points which, to a limited degree, highlight what we have been saying for a long time; namely, that the current Community budget is less than what is needed to properly and effectively promote the proclaimed economic and social cohesion within the European Union. This is even more the case as, despite being in the midst of a crisis, the inadequate limits agreed in the current 2007-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework are not even being fully used - nearly EUR 29 billion short between 2007 and 2009 - and the amounts included in the budget are not being implemented as an 'expenditure' objective, particularly with regard to convergence and to agriculture and fisheries. On the other hand, new priorities are being added, which clash with what we believe should be the objective and central priority of the Community budget: an instrument of redistribution with regard to the costs, inequalities and asymmetries caused by the internal market, by Economic and Monetary Union and by the liberalisation of world trade, for those countries and regions in the European Union which are economically less developed. We should have a Community budget that prioritises real convergence, based on social progress and on protecting and promoting the potential of each country, the sustainable use of natural resources and environmental protection, with the aim of economic and social cohesion, in addition to effective development aid. We also stress that the Community budget should be based on a fair contribution from each country according to its gross national income, therefore firmly rejecting any more or less disguised attempt to introduce European taxes.
costep_2009-03-11_3_53	Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the efforts made by the European institutions in outlining the measures for coordinated actions by Member States and the Commission in dealing with the economic crisis. As is already well known, the European Union’s Cohesion Policy is making an important contribution to the European Economic Recovery Plan and is the Community’s largest source of investments in the real economy. As a gesture in recognition of these efforts, the European Parliament supports the amendments to the regulation on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and Cohesion Fund, in order to simplify and speed up financial management of EU funds. I hope that the beneficiaries will gain from this simplification, those whom the funds are actually targeted at. This is particularly important for the European Union’s poorer Member States. One important task which still faces Member States is to guarantee the necessary funding so that EU resources are spent as intended. Without breaching the rules on free competition and the standards of good management, Member States should use the simplified procedures for funding projects. Thank you for your attention.
costep_2001-10-01_6_2	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this very long title essentially covers machines with which we are all familiar, such as lawn mowers, chain saws, hedge trimmers, drills, all of which are mobile and to which environmental legislation has perhaps given too little attention in recent years. We know, for example, that nowadays a four-stroke lawn mower emits exactly as much in an hour as a car in European category 4 travelling at 150 kilometres per hour. Or we know that, on some days in June this year, 40% of carbon monoxide emissions originated from these mobile machines, 40% of the ozone precursors. That is why we have to do something about this. The proposed directive is all right in so far as it goes, but we made a number of critical observations in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. One point was that we wanted to move the timetable forward a bit, in much the same way as legislation in the United States takes place. We wanted to see if the 'averaging and banking' model was perhaps after all unjustifiable in European terms, being something of a bureaucratic monster that would be hard to keep a check on in Europe and which, to that extent, would tell us little about whether we could achieve the reductions we were aiming for. We tackled this issue very ambitiously in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. As the decision was made in July - in other words, quite some time ago - we were able to negotiate with the Council about this legislation. I can now present a compromise package which the Council is prepared to accept by a large majority, if not unanimously. It is my opinion that we should in this case go down this route and complete the legislation in its entirety in one reading. On the one hand, that would help take the burden off the bureaucratic processes here in the European Parliament and in the Council, and on the other would also, of course, help the environment if the legislation could enter into force more quickly. What is this compromise about? Firstly, we want to move the date of entry into force forward for certain categories. It is about midway between what was decided by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and what was proposed by the Commission. Secondly, we want to dispense with the 'averaging and banking' system because of the bureaucratic difficulties involved in it. In order, however, that environmental legislation should not produce distortions in competition which are not justified in terms of environmental policy, we want to make exceptions possible for small manufacturers producing 25 000 units per annum, and we also want certain products, the SH2 and SH3 machines, to be subject to transitional rules for a period of five years, for example certain chain saws used high up in trees or certain two-stroke motors that drive drills. That is contained in Amendment No 30, so that these machines can be granted extra time - something which, incidentally, corresponds to what industry too has suggested. I cannot therefore go down the road of excluding certain machines from the directive altogether, but I will say: let us give these machines more time if this is justified on technical grounds. I would again remind you how, when we were very ambitious in legislating for cars in categories 3 and 4, we ended up in the Conciliation Committee reaching a reasonable compromise which, of course, met with little approval from the industry at first but which in the final analysis is now appreciated by everybody, because it improves air quality in Europe. I think that the compromise package that I am able to present to you today points in the same direction, the only difference being that it is on the table already and not only after a conciliation procedure. In this respect, what lies before us on the table today is not a 'chain saw massacre', which one newspaper called it but, rather, a durable compromise to improve air quality in Europe.
costep_2001-02-15_3_6	Mr President, Commissioner, nuts, to which we should also add the locust bean, are one of southern Europe’s most common crops. The only specific aid from which they have benefited in the past and from which they benefit today is limited to cofinancing under plans to improve quality and marketing which expired at the end of last year and which the Commission is now proposing to extend by another year. This Commission proposal has come about as a result of the acknowledgement, as made by the Commission itself in the preamble to its proposal, that other measures, for which the sector is also eligible, have not been sufficient or directly applicable to nuts. The Commission therefore promised to present new proposals in a report that it would publish by the end of 2000, which it has still not done. It makes no sense to extend the already scarce measures in place by another year and to say nothing else about the future of this sector, still less so in that the sector is undergoing a particular crisis due to the extremely strong competition from third countries. What would make sense is for nuts to be treated as a separate sector within the Common Organisation of the Markets in fruits and vegetables. This was why, as a matter of fact, at the time of the proposal on the new COM in fruits and vegetables, the European Parliament adopted an amendment requesting the Commission to present proposals that would provide the nut sector with permanent measures and aid of the kind that exist for other agricultural sectors. This is what the rapporteur is proposing and this is what we hope the Commission will put right. In the short term, until these future measures materialise, the most prudent course of action to adopt would be to extend existing aid not by one year but by two, as the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has suggested.
costep_2010-12-15_5_63	Madam President, we are debating a proposed financial stability instrument for the eurozone - an instrument which should help our friends from countries which are currently unable to pay their debts. Everyone here is talking about creating a common financial stability mechanism guaranteed by all eurozone countries, and we expect those who have managed to keep their debts under control to show solidarity with those who have not yet managed to do that. After experiencing the solutions to date for assisting Greece and the one-off protective bulwark erected last time, I wonder what would happen if the financial wizards from the markets picked up their calculators and began working out the actual worth of the solution and discovered that not even this was reliable enough to make them willing to risk investing their money in the area? I wonder if we have any subsequent solutions and subsequent steps prepared? The credibility of the solution at this point in time, according to this scenario, is very low.
costep_2010-05-19_3_85	The Polish Minister for Culture and National Heritage, Bogdan Zdrojewski, has pointed out that one aspect which should be included in the Europe 2020 strategy is culture. I must admit that the Minister’s argument is convincing. For what he wants to do is to 'stress the need to make full use of the potential of culture and the creative industries - Europe’s intellectual and social capital'. The creative industries can be treated as something which will allow Europe to build a competitive advantage. The Europe 2020 strategy was discussed at an informal meeting of Ministers for Culture in March this year. As a result of that discussion, the Spanish Presidency called on 'the Council to recognise and use the creative potential of Europe through culture and its related industries in the 2020 strategy' and on 'Member States and the Commission to work in their respective fields to achieve the objectives through representative initiatives related to innovation, competitiveness, the digital agenda and social inclusion.' I hope these appeals will be heard and put into practice.
costep_2009-09-17_5_42	The Lithuanian Parliament has approved amendments to the Law on the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information. This law aims to prevent the dissemination of public information 'that agitates for homosexual relations' or that 'defies family values'. For this reason, the Lithuanian authorities should amend the law, or repeal it, and should refrain from adopting the amendments to the penal and administrative codes, so as to ensure that laws are compatible with human rights and fundamental freedoms as enshrined in international and European law. It was a step in the right direction when the new President of Lithuania asked the Lithuanian Parliament to reconsider the law to ensure that it complies with the constitutional principles of the rule of law, legal certainty, and legal clarity and that it does not contravene the guarantees of an open society and pluralistic democracy. For these reasons, and due to the urgent need to revise this law, I voted for the joint motion for a resolution of the European Parliament.
costep_2000-11-15_6_4	Mr President, I would like to offer warm thanks to Mr Rocard, and also to Mr Marinos, for their trail-blazing report, which is on the table today. The issue of health insurance has occupied European minds for quite some time now, but the Kohll and Decker decrees, in which the European Court of Justice determined that healthcare received overseas must be remunerated by insurers, has in fact added an extra dimension to this discussion. Mr Rocard’s report, which we have here before us, will help to stimulate debate about the further development of social security in Europe, within the context of growing competition and the rise of the single market in healthcare. One of the main objectives of the current modernisation of social protection is guaranteed access to affordable health protection. It is particularly important for the affordability of health care to be taken into consideration, because the discussion about social security is determined not so much by the quality as by the cost of health care. With its Kohll and Decker decrees, the Court of Justice has sent a clear message to the EU Member States. We are really coming round to the idea of cross-border care and so market forces are becoming increasingly applicable to health care. Whether this will happen, to what extent and when, is still unclear. Research and experiments have shown that it will not open the floodgates to medical tourism. However, there can be no two ways about it; more and more people are going to seek health care overseas. It is therefore imperative that the citizens are our main concern in this process. This issue has one or two implications for us, but it will also have an impact on the national systems. We are talking subsidiarity. National systems of health care, and even the supervision of health insurance, are regulated at national level, but that does not mean that we are not all dealing with the same problems. That is precisely why it is so important - and in fact this is far and away the most significant achievement of this report - for the Commission to produce a Green Paper on supplementary health insurance in the short term. In point of fact, we must ask the Commission whether it is in a position to do this, and if so, how long will it take? Because it is very important. The statistics available to us in this sphere are not comparable, despite our best efforts to this end, and so it is crucial that we have this Green Paper. Apart from that, there is a great deal people want done in the health care sector. A significant number of these aspirations are at national level, but that does not mean that we should not compare notes. Hitherto, this has been somewhat taboo up to a certain point. The Kohll and Decker decree has made a breakthrough. I also think the Rocard report has made a breakthrough on that score, but it is very important for the Commission to take up the initiative now, and come to the table with an actual Green Paper. Once that is in place we will look at how we should take it forward.
costep_1997-03-13_6_50	Madam President, the episode just mentioned by Mr Ford is one of many episodes which unfortunately occur periodically in the Mediterranean and along its shores. At the moment there is a criminal racket in illegal transport of migrants, encouraging clandestine immigration. This racket is also linked to the racket in illegal labour, employed in domestic service, agriculture and construction, but also unfortunately in prostitution. Women and children are particularly subject to this abuse. The criminals we are talking about are unscrupulous people and effective action must be taken against them. For this reason we ask for an investigation into abuses victimizing clandestine workers. We also ask for maximum respect for the human dignity of these migrants and real determination to deal with those who profit from the difficulties and needs of our neighbour peoples. I think this should be put on the agenda for the EuroMediterranean Conference in Malta on 15 and 16 April.
costep_2001-10-03_2_40	Mr President, in light of the seriousness of the terrorist attack of 11 September, there are several important questions to be discussed and clarified, relating to our intention to resolutely fight terrorism. The first question is the need to find effective means to combat terrorism, which do not necessarily entail legislative reform on matters of security. It is worth recalling clearly that it is not effective, and never has been in democracy, to curtail freedoms in order to fight the enemies of democracy itself. Indeed, we think the problem lies elsewhere. It is not only the lack of legislation at national or European level, or the lack of coordinated policing at international level. The problem has much to do both with hesitancy and weakness in the fight against terrorism, which manifest themselves in laxity towards activities of a terrorist nature, in the hope that terrorist acts would always be carried out in the country next door, or in the slow deterioration of methods of defence and security, police forces, information services and armed forces. European governments which thought that wars had ended once and for all and which often cut the financial resources available for defence and safety cannot, of course, talk loudly about terrorism. The second question concerns political awareness of the times in which we live. If we denounce what happened in New York and Washington merely as a criminal act, we will from the start be limiting the scope, the meaning and the effectiveness of the fight against terrorism. What happened is in reality an act of war, no doubt of a war different to previous wars but, unfortunately, all wars are different to previous wars. They are usually more deadly, affecting more civilians and not hesitating to use any means to massacre. They are increasingly total wars. To classify what happened as an act of war is not a mere question of semantics. It has had major implications, starting with the right of the nation or nations affected to respond with military actions, if necessary, in relation to the country or countries shown to be responsible for supporting or carrying out terrorist acts. At present this is a basic condition for effectively fighting terrorism, which cannot attain the magnitude of the attack of 11 September without the support of one or more States. Unfortunately, there has been little discussion on this subject, but it is necessary to know the position of the Council, Parliament and the Commission concerning the need for military intervention against States which perpetrate or support terrorist acts.
costep_1997-07-15_8_21	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if I may refer to my own report, on which we voted only a few weeks ago, on 12 June 1997, Parliament voted by a large majority against cutting compensatory payments for certain crop plants and for set-aside. At the same time, Parliament backed the Committee on Budgets in opposing deferment of the oilseed advance. In a further amendment contained in my report it was also decided that the payments per hectare envisaged in the CAP reform package should be guaranteed in full for 1998 and 1999. I do find it quite astonishing that there should now be moves to deviate from this line without a reasonable alternative being presented. Yesterday the farming press was already telling us that land and animal premiums were to remain the basis of future EU agricultural policy. Commissioner Liikanen, as a Member of the Commission you no doubt played a part in that decision. Regrettably, we have learned about it from the newspapers before it could be announced here. On enquiring, we are told that the newspaper reports are accurate. I am very interested in what you are going to say to us, how you intend to secure the acceptance of the farming community for a future agriculture policy if it is merely a continuation of present policy. The fact is that we rather believed you stood for a new agricultural policy, for a policy that we could sustain, instead of which we are to have more payments per hectare and livestock premiums. And you believe, do you, that farmers would approve of our continued support for this system? I am very eager to hear what you have to say. My special thanks go to our colleague Mr Mulder, who presented a very cogent argument; we fully endorse the points he made. We do not want to run our heads against the wall. We should far rather continue to work in harmony with the Committee on Budgets.
costep_2007-05-23_6_43	In spite of the controversy generated by this report, which has been sorted out in time, I feel that the report in its current form reaffirms existing rights and fosters patient mobility. This was precisely the intention. Given the particular importance of this issue, the debate must encompass the broad range of different systems in the various EU Member States. In any event, the most important thing is to make sure that the facilities opened up by patient mobility are clear and viable. Health is one of the issues that the citizens hold most dear and it would be wrong to impose solutions on the Member States by means of Community legislation that would undermine rules on which the citizens and the politicians have agreed. Nevertheless this does not stop rules from being introduced to facilitate the use of this facility in a free area such as the EU, where there is a tradition of mobility on various issues. I therefore feel that the outcome is a positive one, and favourable to the citizens' interests and rights.
costep_1997-05-14_11_23	Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Council has answered this question like a bureaucrat, with meaningless words. It did not answer my specific question, which is how and when the regulation is going to be approved. It did that for the central and eastern European countries. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a young Czech, Rumanian or Hungarian can get skills training and benefit from the programmes. A young person from the Maghreb cannot. We have an association policy with the southern Mediterranean countries based on equilibrium, based on free trade and based on working together. How we are going to be able to work with them with the enormous imbalance that there is today as regards skills qualifications? How can Europeans do this, open markets and close doors to training people? Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have not answered my question. This is a serious responsibility. We are discriminating against the poorest countries, the countries of the southern Mediterranean.
costep_2005-09-29_1_148	Mr President, I would like to express my total respect for the people of Serbia, for Serbia itself and for its aspirations to reintegrate itself into the international community, and also for the Serbians’ call to be respected wherever they are minorities. That is precisely what gives us the legitimacy to demand that they treat the minorities in their territory with full dignity. Serbia’s call for respect for the Serbian minority in Kosovo for example — in which it has our every support, and there will be other opportunities to talk about that — will remain entirely illegitimate unless it ceases allowing and tolerating, either passively, or in some cases with direct involvement, abuses, aggression and harassment against the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina. I believe that it is very important that we approve this resolution in order to send a clear double message: on the one hand, to the government of Serbia so that it knows we are here and we are watching and, on the other, to the European Commission and this Parliament so that this issue can be treated as a priority and is not just studied by a handful of experts and so that we are aware that there are daily violations of human rights very close to our borders.
costep_2002-01-16_6_17	Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to stress the support of the Liberal Group and of my party, Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya, in order to ensure that this Presidency ends with a positive assessment, with distinction, which will include it in the category of the two previous Spanish Presidencies. Of the issues mentioned as priorities for the present Presidency, I would like to stress the following three. That the meeting of the Barcelona European Council, in March, provides concrete commitments and results which can be confirmed, in order to ensure the effective implementation of the structural reforms and liberalisation processes necessary for complying with the objectives set in the process initiated at the Lisbon Council. That the Euro-Mediterranean Council serves to promote a new stage in the process begun, also under a Spanish Presidency, in Barcelona in 1995, in order to ensure greater and better cooperation between the European Union and the third countries of the Mediterranean. We are in favour of the creation of a financial institution which allows the full and effective application of the funds agreed for the Mediterranean programmes. We must intensify the Union’s external policy, in which much of its future peace and stability is at stake. In your key role as a member of the Praesidium of the Convention, we ask that you ensure the incorporation and participation of the constitutional regions in the institutions of the European Union in the constituent text to be agreed at the Intergovernmental Conference of 2004. As the chairman of the Liberal Group stressed in his speech, the European Union cannot be considered complete unless it includes the full participation and integration of the Europe of the Regions. It is an issue to which, under the Spanish Presidency, which will begin with the Convention, we attach the greatest importance, as has been stressed.
costep_1997-03-10_5_7	Mr President, there is a lot of criticism that can be made of the Schengen Agreement and its execution. There is talk again of secret agendas and unverifiable actions by the governments; no parliamentary control, no proper judicial control, and so forth. Schengen must therefore be only a transitional thing. In the future we must integrate it into the European Union. Moreover, in the coming revision of the Maastricht Treaty we must communitize as many as possible of the matters that fall now within the ambit of Schengen. That means giving competence to the European Parliament - including it, that is to say - and also giving competence to the Court of Justice in this field. To that end the Schengen secretariat must be brought under the European Union’s wing. My next point has to do with the Netherlands-France drugs war, as it has been aptly called. I think that France must now bring an end to vigilance on its northern border, as the main tenet of the Schengen Agreement so demands. The Dutch, on the other hand, must do more to meet foreign criticism of Dutch drugs policy. Rapprochement leading to European harmonization on drugs policy is what is needed. France must do more to help addicts and the Netherlands must do more to combat drug production and the trade in drugs. Those countries must tackle the problem together with the other Member States. Following the vote on the amendments we like the general tenor of Mrs Van Lancker’s report and we shall therefore vote for it. We compliment her on her excellent work.
costep_2001-01-31_4_28	Mr President, only a year ago, the eastwards enlargement policy was considered to be a possible line of development for Europe. Today, it is undeniably a fundamental part of European policy. I hope that the same will become true of Mediterranean policy as of today, not only because the Middle East is one of the most insecure areas on our borders or because the southern side of the Mediterranean is the greatest source of migration towards Europe, but also, I am glad to say, because, as President Prodi recently stated, having already discovered America we have now discovered Asia, and the Mediterranean has resumed its key position in world trade and exchange which must be exploited on both northern and southern sides. In my opinion, if this is true the performance of the MEDA programme cannot be taken as the benchmark, although I am convinced that careful evaluation of its results would shed a different light on things, but there are three lines to be explored: firstly, increasing mutual understanding through decentralised cooperation, which can be strongly encouraged; secondly, a training programme for the ruling classes of the Mediterranean, which Europe must involve in order to guarantee itself a better future; thirdly, defining sustainable sea transport policies in the Mediterranean, which will become a central point either of danger or of major development for both northern and southern sides of the Basin.
costep_2011-06-23_14_377	This is the only report seeking to go against the dominant trend for the economic governance package as a whole. I abstained from the vote to highlight this aspect and acknowledge its value. Mrs Ferreira’s report is concerned with preventing severe macroeconomic imbalances. In it, deficit and debt are no more important than surpluses and commercial deficits, than employment and unemployment, or than any qualitative challenges that might ensure a sustainable growth strategy. It is sensible to have this type of wide-ranging coordination, based on a scoreboard of various indicators that identifies imbalances at an early stage. What prevents me from voting for this report is the fact that it is the poor relation of a form of coordination whose beginning and end are still deficit and debt.
costep_2011-06-09_5_56	Madam President, this debate got off to a bad start, with the good guys, the anti-nuclear people, on one side, and the bad guys, those who still support nuclear power, on the other. I would nevertheless point out again that nuclear power is part of the energy mix that we here in this Parliament wanted and hoped for. Next, I would like to complain a bit about this debate, with its appeals to collective fear. This is regrettable when we are dealing with a subject as important as this one. It is true that nuclear power stations can, in certain cases, pose risks, but I am quite shocked because there is a certain mistrust here in this Parliament of staff who work in nuclear power stations on a daily basis and who ensure the safety of our nuclear power from day to day. I would ask you to be responsible, therefore. We know that there is a desire in the European Union to ensure the security of our power stations from day to day. I would also like to add that we know perfectly well that flying over nuclear power stations is prohibited - at least, in France - and that there is no nuclear power station in France which is further than 25 km from an air base, with the air bases being responsible for monitoring the air space above nuclear power stations. So yes, Commissioner, we agree with you. We are in agreement on these tests. Congratulations, you have got them. These tests are essential, because we have to make sure that our populations regain confidence in our nuclear power stations. These tests are essential; they must take place in a spirit of complete independence so that this confidence can be regained. We can also see, however, that confidentiality is necessary in certain cases. When it comes to combating terrorism, we cannot conceive of a Member State revealing strategic plans for combating terrorism in advance. So, let us take some responsibility. Let us have confidence in our Commissioner, and I am convinced that we will have tests which are rigorous and which are capable of reassuring us.
costep_2007-12-13_4_18	The consequence of globalisation within the European area is that productive undertakings are the losers and undertakings exporting technology are the winners. That is all very clearly reflected in internal cohesion. In the case of the textile industry, the fact that the sector is mainly made up of small and medium-sized enterprises is a disadvantage on the market that represents 6% of total world trade and an estimated turnover of EUR 566 billion. In addition, many producer regions are suffering the consequences of economic restructuring, so that it is difficult to achieve sustainability in the sector. European production is forced to compete with that of countries that artificially devalue their currency, do not respect environmental protection rules or bear the costs of environmental protection, that frequently infringe intellectual property rights or, even more seriously, on the social and employment front, apart from having much lower wage costs, do not apply such stringent worker protection measures as Europe does. It is therefore all the more pressing to make sure that WTO rules are respected and that the Commission is able to monitor imports, not allowing a veil to be artificially drawn over the excesses noted in practice with China as regards textile imports, as has happened in the past. The Commission must adopt all the measures needed to safeguard the interests of the European Union, including if necessary the imposition of quotas on China, possibly up to the end of 2008, within the WTO legal framework and must also insist upon total respect for the rules of fair play. European producers lack incentives for research and development and for improving the skills of the labour force, they do not have appropriate access to external markets or an effective means of preventing counterfeiting. Intellectual property is basic to the added value of the sector and must be defended at all costs in order to encourage production with a high added value. Finally, Mr President, Commissioner, consumer safety must not be forgotten. It falls to the Commission to prevent any product that might be harmful to our families from coming into the homes of Europe’s citizens.
costep_2000-05-17_11_12	Mr President, I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his answer. I must, however, regretfully inform him that his answer was still particularly vague, as my question referred to a European Parliament resolution adopted in 1987, in which, effectively, we officially recognised events such as the genocide of the Armenians between 1915 and 1917. We do not, however, know today what measures have been taken by successive Councils in order to attempt to establish relations between both these countries, given that today Turkey is still imposing an economic blockade on Armenia. My question is therefore as follows: in the context of negotiations with a view to Turkey’s accession to the European Union, has the issue of this blockade been raised, and could lifting this blockade be counted a precondition to Turkey’s accession?
costep_1999-10-06_6_35	Mr President, Mr Sasi, the liberalisation of world trade is preparing to take a big step forward at Seattle. With European integration, the EU has grown into a major global influence on the economy, for which only a broad-based round of negotiations will make it possible to ensure steady economic growth. Of all the important issues on the agenda for the talks, the liberalisation of trade in services is the most challenging. The European Union is the world’s largest player in the field of trade in services. Services account for the largest share of GNP in the European Union, and, what is more, that share is growing all the time; and that is good. One of the greatest barriers to free trade in services is the lack of any global set of norms relating to tendering for contracts in the public sector. International companies must have converging opportunities to make tenders for contracts, and the public sector must be opened up to international competition. Furthermore, the rules of global commerce must be defined to safeguard the rights of the market operators. Similarly, we must substantially develop a scheme to gauge the international comparability of rules of copyright. The main aim of the talks is to ensure the quality of services on offer. If the European markets are opened up, any external agent offering services must meet the same high standards that exist in Europe. Any monitoring mechanisms used to check levels of quality must be clear as to their principles and as open as possible with regard to the communication of information. It is especially important that the fast growing services of the information society become subject to an agreement. The advantage of the development of the modern trade in services in Europe is that it maximises the benefits of increased commercial exploitation of information technology. Electronic shopping must clearly be made easier, and regulation and taxation in this area must be kept to a minimum. At the talks we must be able to ensure that electronic shopping remains free and dynamic, and guarantee the possibilities for developments in electronic shopping in Europe in the next Millennium also.
costep_2001-11-15_12_2	Commissioner, Mr President, just as certain small-scale conflicts receive poor media coverage, so certain categories of what are known as light weapons could be said to receive poor legislative and financial coverage. I mean that the legislation regulating them is insufficient and that they are cheap to buy. Why are we surprised, then, when it is this type of arms which keep these forgotten conflicts alive? Yet the number of victims alone should concern us, if it were not concealed by the effects of poverty. However, evidence that the world does have a conscience has emerged in the shape of the United Nations Programme of Action aimed at containing and controlling the transfers, or rather the trafficking of these light weapons which are responsible for extensive loss of human life. In the light of the current international situation, with the armed alliance in Afghanistan and the international fight against terrorism, there is even greater need for the Union to join and support this resolute, pioneering UN measure. The European Union’s military policy must be more than just defence measures controlled by senior military staff. It must, in essence, be based on the prevention and control of the arms trade by an arsenal of binding laws covering all areas of this industry. Our legislation must target arms brokering and export and detention licences, as well as extradition and police cooperation procedures, and national legislation governing these issues must be harmonised. Instead of attempting to intervene in blazing conflicts, would it not be better to defuse them before they ignite? The Union’s legislative structure would allow us to do this at the stage when we are still preparing for military action. Europe must seize the opportunity afforded here.
costep_2005-11-30_1_205	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 10th report on the regulation of the electronic communications markets is a very important document for the sector because it provides an objective and in-depth analysis of market trends, both with regard to technological and economic developments in the sector and with regard to measures aimed at promoting competition. I wish to extend my sincere thanks for the excellent work done by Mrs Toia, with whom I agree that the information and communications technology sector is enormously relevant both for the Community economy and for individual countries, given the notable contribution it makes to employment growth and the development of new technologies to improve and speed up communications. European legislation is required to regulate the relationship between producer and user and to guarantee that digital technology is available to all, that governments invest more in infrastructure and, above all, that free and fair competition is maintained, thus ensuring better quality services at more and more favourable prices. The report addresses five thematic areas. First: the improvement of international roaming services, with a reduction in tariffs and greater transparency in billing and the drawing up of contracts. Second: the establishment of a clear framework to regulate the institutional relationship between the European Commission and the European Regulators Group, to increase the responsibility and involvement of national authorities - thereby restoring competitiveness - and to provide greater incentives for investment, especially in the new emerging markets. Third: an increase in the number of power lines so that broadband connection is available to all, without territorial limits and in the shortest time possible. Fourth: the protection of user health, as argued by the rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who fully supports the rapporteur, Mrs Toia, hoping that the European Parliament will accept the recommendations in her report. Finally I wish to congratulate Mr Reading on the work he is and will be doing in his report on research, which has the full support of the PPE-DE.
costep_2008-05-08_9_8	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great satisfaction to make this explanation of vote while you are in the Chair, Mrs Morgantini, and especially with the welcome sound of Members applauding behind me. I wish to say in my personal capacity, and this relates to me personally as an individual Member and also as a representative of the Pensioners' Party, that I voted against this report on the regulation of lobbies. The reason is this: I am unimpressed by the fact that it is taken for granted that Members of the European Parliament are influenced in their decisions by other people, and that, consequently, regulation is deemed necessary. True enough, I have always been influenced in my decision-making by Carlo Fatuzzo, by Carlo Fatuzzo alone and by none other than Carlo Fatuzzo. I therefore find it very odd that any such possibility can be accepted. If anything at all were to be done, or should be done, to help us better understand the documents on which we vote, we ought to have experts available who each say the opposite of the other, and then we can use our own intelligence to decide. I would conclude by asking myself and asking you this, Madam President: who influenced the decision to regulate lobbies? There is obviously a lobby - the lobby of lobbies - which has influenced the rules on lobbies!
costep_1997-11-19_7_3	Mr president, I too voted against this resolution. The reason was that I do not believe that the intergovernmental conference is any longer the right way to further the development of the European union. It is in many respects a failure. I believe it will, for example, lead to the European parliament’s inability to effectively influence amendments to the treaty. Europol is a good example of how the protection by law of citizens is in danger when governments are disinclined to give either the European Parliament or national assemblies sufficient powers of democratic supervision. The other example of an inter-governmental conference’s ineptitude in solving these fundamental problems is EMU. The issue is whether in formulating economic and monetary union we will have created an essentially federalist part of the EU, while there will be a move to administer it as if it were an inter-governmental project. With that, the democracy deficit and the future lack of central bank control is clear. I think we ought to switch to the kind of constitutional legal process whereby the rights of citizens would be an important ingredient in the debate.
costep_2006-11-13_16_19	Mr President, Commissioner, it gives me great satisfaction to announce my support for the European Commission’s presentation of the first annual report on the situation in the euro zone. The report provides a good basis for discussing the main challenges facing the euro zone now and in the coming years. There is plenty to discuss. The average growth rate in the euro zone in 2001-2005 was a mere 1.9%. Unemployment rose to 13 million, and the situation with public finances got worse, rather than improving. Last year did bring a slight improvement in the situation, as you were kind enough to confirm, but this does not change the fact that Europe is falling further behind not just the United States and Japan, but also the Asian boom countries. Unresolved structural problems lie at the root of European stagnation. The high cost of setting up and running a business, high overheads on labour costs, reluctance to innovate, and the maintenance of harmful barriers to the labour market and the services market all reduce the competitiveness of European firms, holding back growth and increasing pressure on public finances. It prevents us from making full use of the opportunities offered by a common currency and a uniform monetary policy. I therefore call upon the European Commission to put pressure on the Member States to speed up implementation of the necessary reforms. The need for this has been demonstrated in numerous reports and studies, including the Shapiro report and the high-level report made under the chairmanship of Wim Kok. Macroeconomic policy in the euro zone needs to be improved. What is missing above all is proper coordination of fiscal policy among the Member States. At the same time, the common currency requires fiscal discipline which needs to be observed jointly by all Member States. This will make it possible to balance macroeconomic policy and to restore a proper policy mix. Monetary policy needs to be based on clear, transparent rules, and must be more forward-looking in character. Excessive secrecy in decision-making, lack of clear regulations on the role played by the 'two pillars' of monetary policy, particularly the M3 monetary supply, which create serious doubts regarding the rules for appointing members of the board of the European Central Bank, all restrict the effectiveness and transparency of the common monetary policy, and may undermine the position of the common currency. A substantial element in strengthening the euro zone is expanding it and taking on new members. In this process we must observe the rule that candidates are bound by the treaty, the whole treaty and nothing but the treaty. This means that they must meet the criteria set out in the treaty, but also that additional requirements cannot be imposed upon them. I am convinced that the accession of new euro zone members, whose deficit and public debt levels are often much lower than those of the other Member States, will help to strengthen the euro zone. In conclusion, I would like to thank Mr Juncker, the president of the Euro Group, for taking part in our debate, and hope that it will inspire him and help him to manage the Euro Group even better. I would also like to thank Mr García-Margallo y Marfil for preparing this excellent report, and give my full agreement to the majority of the proposals made in it.
costep_2010-02-24_17_23	This report is one-sided. It levels a great deal of criticism at Israel because, amongst other reasons, it fired on economic and civilian targets. However, Hamas misused these facilities. Unfortunately, Mr Goldstone has not seen fit to investigate whether this actually was the case. Mr Goldstone has therefore failed to investigate what Hamas did wrong and consequently rapped Israel over the knuckles. That inspires no confidence in this report, because there are other sources which suggest that Hamas did indeed entrench itself in hospitals, ambulances and civilian buildings. Mr President, I will conclude on a positive note. The Goldstone report makes many accusations and they have to be investigated. The Israeli Government has rightly taken the initiative in this regard and has launched a criminal investigation. That is to be welcomed. Yet I fear that we will have to wait a long time for Hamas to show the same level of self-examination.
costep_2011-06-08_7_251	The resolution voted on today sets out a series of measures to reduce the current dependency on a very few ratings sources. As well as an increase in competition, these measures include greater and judicious use of internal credit ratings, particularly by large financial institutions that are capable of performing their own risk assessments. We were certainly somewhat divided on this subject during the initial phases, but in our final positions, we were substantially in agreement. Consensus was also reached on the issue of transparency, since I support the idea to oblige all registered rating agencies to conduct an annual review to assess their past credit rating performances, with this information then being passed on to the supervisor.
costep_2008-05-08_4_15	Mr. President, dear colleagues, those who know me can tell for sure that sport and everything related to physical education is a way of life for me. I accept the publication of the White Paper on Sport with the hope that it will provide the foundations of a future consistent policy. I believe that when we speak of an European policy in this field, we should think, first and foremost, of our children, their health, future and social integration. The encouragement of sport in the educational standards is an important factor for the psychological and physical development of our children, a major tool for the protection of their health. The adoption of the White Paper and the establishment of an integrated structure at the European level to develop, promote and implement common policies in each type of sport, starting from sport for the youngest all the way to professional sport, not forgetting, of course, people with disabilities, will offer all citizens opportunities for participation and personal involvement in the community and contribute to the encouragement of the intercultural dialogue.
costep_2010-11-11_9_203	The European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) need to be strengthened. The role of the latter is important and essential in a whole series of sectors, particularly for the part it plays in security and the defence of democracy. Even if these two organisations have different needs, objectives and structures, it is important that there are no contrasting positions or overlaps liable to cause conflicts of competence. Their roles are defined and different, but in any case, there is a risk of duplication in some areas. I voted in favour of this resolution, since I support both its content and its spirit. Indeed, I believe that OSCE is an essential organisation that positions itself as a forum and takes account of both EU-Asia and EU-United States relations. Clearly, given its Member States, the European Union is both the fulcrum and the base of the OSCE, so I hope that it has a leading role within it.
costep_2010-12-16_7_83	One of the main reasons why I did not support this report is because not only does it suggest the immediate withdrawal of European troops, but also it 'welcomes and supports' the plan to strengthen EU action. Likewise, it scarcely questions the role played by the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and the grave human rights abuses committed. I consider it positive that the report includes the statements by General Stanley McChrystal in which he denies that there is sufficient al-Qaeda presence to justify the deployment of troops in Afghanistan. I also think that it is positive that the report calls for police training to cease being in the hands of private contractors as soon as possible, along with the recital stating that there is no obvious end in sight for the war in Afghanistan due to the militarism and warmongering that has taken place so far. I did not support the report because my firm, consistent commitment to pacificist values lead me to criticise this report, the spirit and focus of which are entirely opposed to the need to demilitarise the EU’s foreign policy and its foreign relations.
costep_2000-11-15_9_8	Madam President, I believe that the BSE crisis that broke out in 1996 has revealed the extent to which ultraliberalism can lead to the health of consumers and the interests of livestock producers being sacrificed. The work of this Parliament’s committee of enquiry contributed to the application of measures to protect consumer health: in particular by banning animal meal for cattle and through the compulsory labelling of beef. But fraud, negligence and the lack of adequate measures mean that the BSE crisis is still not under control, since new cases are being discovered all the time. Without becoming paranoid, we must recognise that the consumers' concern is perfectly legitimate. My group believes that the health of consumers is an imperative which should have overriding priority over all other considerations. It is therefore urgent that measures are taken to reassure consumers and to restore their confidence in food safety. I do not know if this is a panacea, Commissioner but, in line with the precautionary principle, it seems to me that experience behoves us to ban, as of today, the use of animal meal in feed for livestock, including pigs, poultry and fish. Detection tests must also be extended to all cattle entering the human food chain. The current crisis has led to a significant slump in sales and to a fall in prices, which are hurting livestock producers and all those involved in the beef sector. It is necessary both to restore consumer confidence and to help the livestock producers affected by the crisis. Selective aid, such as market support and a grass subsidy, are essential. But, beyond the immediate future, should we not be reflecting on the mechanisms of the CAP? Are these not the very mechanisms which are at the root of the problem? They have contributed to overly intensive production, which has harmed the environment and the quality of farm products. They therefore need to be reviewed. Perhaps it would be no bad thing if animals returned to traditional fodder. I feel like saying, Yes, let them have a bit more grass. But the European Union must also encourage the production of oil seeds so that animal meal can be replaced by vegetable meal. To achieve this, there would have to be a re-examination of the 1993 GATT agreement, which prohibits the European Union producing more than 25% of its vegetable protein requirements so as to satisfy US exports.
costep_1997-10-01_4_19	Mr President, we are currently in a transitional period until monetary union comes into effect, allowing us to become more competitive, and our economies to converge. But the fact of the matter is that the Member States are currently making major efforts to improve their financial situations, and to converge. I should like the President of the Commission to give an assessment of Member States' efforts towards the convergence of their economies, and the effects these efforts are having on the labour market and job creation. I should also like to hear the President of the Commission’s judgement of how well the multiannual employment programmes have been adhered to since 1995, and what value the Commission places on these programmes.
costep_2009-12-14_18_36	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to the fundamental importance of micro-credit in these times of crisis for jobs. Micro-credit allows the unemployed to make a new start, thanks to risk-sharing and financing instruments, making entrepreneurship accessible. Given the financial crisis and the significant drop in the number of loans being granted, I support the proposal by the European Commission to establish a microfinance instrument targeting the most vulnerable groups, and particularly women, young people and the unemployed. I would like to give my backing to my colleagues in the Group of the European People’s Party which, together with the other groups - socialists, liberals and conservatives - have tabled compromise amendments in order to set up this microfinance instrument as quickly as possible, starting in 2010. I also call upon the Council of Ministers to take responsibility for finding, in the current crisis situation, a swift solution to combat unemployment and provide a lasting solution to the funding of this micro-credit.
costep_2008-06-16_26_9	Mr President, Commissioner, I am grateful to Mr Harangozó for his attention to vulnerable groups. Cohesion policy has been making an important contribution to improving conditions for vulnerable groups for a long time now. Take, for example, Ireland, once a country with very vulnerable groups: very high youth unemployment, rundown towns, underdeveloped countryside, with virtually no opportunities. For many other countries, too, social exclusion is to be replaced by employment, education and participation. That is the direction we are going in and it is extremely successful. My second point: I have seen it said in particular that we know too little, have too little information. I agree that that could be improved, especially by the Member States, the regions and the towns themselves. Mr Harangozó wonders why the life expectancy of Hungarians is 15% lower than average life expectancy in the EU. I do not know either, but I have visited hospitals. Eating and drinking habits are extraordinarily bad, and the European Community can do nothing about that. I think that for people to take responsibility themselves in the regions is one of the most important bases of our policy. Finally, what is the underlying reason for the EPP being against NUTS 4? We are against it because in 2004 we opted for strengthening of the policy up to 2013, for more substance, more focus. We even decided to include the whole external border, as it were, in the policy on Interreg areas on the external borders. That tends to mean that we will be fragmenting, we will be dissipating our efforts, and that should not be the direction we take in this area in the future. That would be a mistake. I am therefore asking you once again to delete the article concerned. Otherwise I accept the challenge the rapporteur has also set out, to have an intensive debate with each other about territorial cohesion with each other in the next sixth months.
costep_2009-09-15_11_42	Mr President, Mr Barroso, I have a problem which means that I am not going to vote for you tomorrow, but you know what it is, since my group has explained it well. It is a political issue. You do not have a project for transforming Europe environmentally and socially. And yet that is, I believe, what needs to be done today. However, as Mr Daul elegantly put it, it was the right that won the elections, therefore you are on the right. The situation is clear. I should like, however, to be able to have respect for the President of the Commission, but I have a problem with this: when I see you, I inevitably think - and I assure you this is true - of your responsibility in the CIA’s secret flights. Between 2002 and 2006, 728 people were transferred to Guantánamo via Portuguese airspace. You were minister from 2002 to 2004. I therefore cannot believe you, Mr Barroso, when you make declamations about Europe being a champion of human rights. What I expect from you - what I hope for from you, because I would like, in the future, to respect you as President of the Commission - is not your memoirs, in however many years' time, but that you will acknowledge your responsibilities in this serious act, which casts a shadow over European values.
costep_2000-07-07_3_18	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks to Denmark for this excellent initiative, and thanks too to the rapporteur for the good work. It is definitely so that when the fines are small, environmental crime becomes lucrative. But we have to remember that this branch of criminality also affects people, people within and outside the workplace. The framework decision would prevent this sort of crime from being profitable. In my opinion, however, the multinational giants are the big problem, and co-operation between the authorities is needed in this area, also so that these regulations might enter into force before enlargement. The worst environmental crimes are those perpetrated by companies, for which it is just part of their business. Some of these are repeatedly found guilty of these crimes. It is just this repeated, intentional, environmentally criminal activity that is what we should be looking into. I hope that the Commission will make a public register of such companies, as for them it has become just a part of their business. Consumers and people in general could then bring public opinion to bear on the situation. I come from a country where we can initiate criminal proceedings against a corporate body, and that has had an impact and preventive effect there. It is obvious that the director of a company will take a more serious view of the environment, as it is possible that he will end up isolated from it as a result of having gone to prison for criminally abusing it. I therefore think that when people start having to face the consequences, progress will be made in the matter both within the Union and in other respects.
costep_2000-10-04_7_35	As far as some of us are concerned, Poland’s accession to the European Union will symbolise deliverance. In this Europe that General de Gaulle had once described as a 'cathedral', Poland has a unique but well-deserved place. The historic, cultural and even emotional links which my country has maintained for centuries with Poland make us French perhaps more sensitive than others to the nature of the welcome which should be reserved for a nation which, almost single-handedly, sums up all the glories and all the tragedies in the experience of this continent of ours. Regarded for far too long as the prime battleground for neighbouring aggressors, who always saw the annexation of Poland as the first stop on their expansionist itinerary, the unwilling arena for one of the most abhorrent tragedies in history, and subsequently left for decades to oppression by a totalitarian regime which, encouraged by our culpable silence, thought that it could finally quash Poland’s legendary spirit of resistance, Poland has never ceased to demonstrate forcefully the values of freedom, courage and independence, all those shared values that form the foundation stone on which our construction of a political Europe is supposed to stand. We therefore have a duty to embrace Poland as a Member as soon as possible and treat the country as it deserves, as one of our Members for all time. Spare us the doubtful audits and requirements for standardisation that are so inopportune. Blinkered application of these would exacerbate rather than improve the situation in this country. With 25% of the population employed in agriculture, Poland is not Luxembourg, and the debates on the candidate countries' adoption of the Community acquis sometimes take on a surrealist tone, unless we accept the outrageous idea of a multi-speed Europe where, of all the disparities between peoples, only economic disparities actually counted. No, Poland deserves better than a conditional welcome. Its past is its best passport, and its dignity its best argument. Most of all, this country, which has ceaselessly fought against all hegemony, will bring us a new but, at the same time, experienced insight enabling us to parry the risks of any new imperialism, even that apparently inoffensive one - which may yet be a harbinger of the worst perils - of noble sentiments and a quiet conscience on the cheap. In welcoming Poland to our common home, the European Union will be doing justice to a newcomer, justice that has been denied to it for far too long. Jürgen Schröder Report A5-0245/2000
costep_2000-03-15_2_27	Mr President, these reports are heading in the right direction but we cannot accept the self-satisfaction of the recitals in the current treaties. To be effective, the fight against discrimination requires broader and, in particular, more specific measures. Therefore, any restriction linked to nationality for access to civil service jobs must be abolished. The institutions of the Community and Member States must lead the way in this. In the same way, full citizenship implies giving third country nationals resident in the European Union the right to vote in all elections. As long as these third country nationals are refused political rights, they will be the target of demagogy and discrimination. If their status as taxpayers justifies their access to this right, why limit this to the local and European levels? Finally, in Europe the situation of all illegal immigrants must be legalised in order to fight against the traffic in labour and the xenophobic hatred which has recently been seen, in Spain, for example. This would mean breaking with the provisions of the Schengen, Amsterdam and Dublin Treaties which are real insults to the right of asylum. We believe that the fight against racism does not really require a legal arsenal, however good this may be, but rather specific measures to eliminate unemployment and exclusion. This is where we expect to see progress.
costep_2002-10-22_2_107	Madam President, I too would like to express my concern over the lot of development aid in the budget. Rigour is the watchword. Budget headings are removed and reduced, and I feel we are far from a budget that meets our needs and expectations. Apart from the fact that the increase in this part of the budget is only superficial, since account must be taken of the inclusion of pre-accession aid for Cyprus, Malta and, in particular, Turkey, the general trend conveyed by the figures is not an indication of a great desire on the part of the Union to shoulder its responsibilities with regard to the South. How odd it is to set the objective of eradicating poverty and, at the same time, cut funds for development aid. The cuts are clear: less for food aid, less for Latin America. They are particularly serious for the Mediterranean and the Balkans, without counting the possibility of further cuts which will have to be made if funding for aid to Afghanistan is not found from other resources. Who can we convince that this so-called reallocation of funds to other headings will lead to more appropriations, greater effectiveness in responding to the needs of the people concerned? Without a proper review of the Financial Perspectives, the pressure on heading 4 is becoming untenable. Following the abolition of the Development Council, such a budget would send a very bad signal. Another example is the negotiations which have just begun with a view to the signing of economic partnership agreements with our ACP partners. Considerable adjustment efforts are asked of them; that is a financial constraint which cannot be sustained by the ACP countries themselves or by the EDF, but which requires supplementary funds to be specially allocated by the European Union. Lastly, I wish to lend my support to my group’s proposal to create a specific heading for aid to Palestine. Some claim that the projects funded by the European Union should be abandoned, if they are destined to be systematically destroyed. Several months ago now, Commissioner Patten estimated the destruction of such infrastructures by the Israeli army at EUR 20 million. Nevertheless, the Union must certainly not give in to the law of the survival of the fittest and must act as required by law. That is what Commissioner Patten has constantly reiterated, calling for a serious and concerted effort required to reform and rebuild the Palestinian Authority, as the only viable interlocutor in future peace talks. This will be achieved through the political and budgetary transparency of this objective.
costep_2011-01-17_16_11	Madam President, illegal logging in Central African countries, such as Cameroon and the Congo, constitutes a threat to the integrity of resources on which the local communities and indigenous peoples depend for their existence and way of life. Indeed, it is a threat to an ecosystem that is home to enormous biodiversity and plays a very important role in regulating biogeochemical cycles. Given the advancing destruction of the tropical rainforest in this region - and let us not forget that it is fed by the demand of operators and importers in industrialised countries, particularly countries in the European Union - the solution cannot possibly be to legalise what is illegal today, the unsustainable exploitation of the rainforest, which would be nothing short of a legitimisation of the theft of land from the local communities and the occupation of vast areas of rainforest by timber companies, as has been occurring. The European Union’s development cooperation and aid policy has a very important role to play here in supporting the diversification of the economy of these countries and turning a model based heavily on the extraction and export of a small number of raw materials to industrialised countries completely on its head.
costep_2008-06-16_25_22	I welcome the Commission’s proposal to designate 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. Poverty is a problem both in the EU and worldwide. I would like to highlight some acute aspects of poverty and social exclusion on which we should focus much more attention than we used to. First of all, simply by eliminating child poverty we would be able to escape the vicious circle of generations condemned to a life of poverty and social exclusion. Secondly, nearly 10% of workers experience poverty because of low wages, part-time employment and low qualifications. It is essential to promote quality employment based on educating employees. Thirdly, it is vital to promote solidarity within society, making all its members aware of the issues of poverty and social exclusion. I would like to encourage all EU institutions and Member States to provide the members of society with more detailed information on combating poverty and social exclusion in order to increase the sense of common responsibility and help disperse the prejudice of being a financial burden on society.
costep_2000-12-14_8_6	Mr President, although this Parliament is bringing southern Africa back to our agenda and particularly Mozambique, one of the poorest countries in the world, which, as we know, was devastated exactly a year ago by a huge natural disaster. As you know, Mozambique is situated in one of the hottest and most sensitive spots on the African continent, where any spark may trigger off another war with unimaginable consequences. The international community must exercise its right of democratic vigilance, not in order to interfere in the internal affairs of an independent country but as a precautionary and preventative political procedure. Therefore, this joint resolution, which is objective, clear, shows genuine concern and is not demagogic, has the earnest support of my political group; sharing an economic, social and political diagnosis in which its concerns are well-founded, it does not allow any other interpretation of its text that may divide the Mozambican people. This Parliament agrees not to forget any factor that may jeopardise the peace and the democratic future of Mozambique. However, responsibly, it does not side with any factions seeking power or position; instead it sides with the Mozambicans and their right to a better life. With time we all learn something and, in this exercise of political common sense, Parliament forgets nothing but remembers everything, and believes that those responsible in Mozambique will read and understand the essence of this resolution, in the certainty that we remain ready and willing to help them without any paternalism of any kind. This resolution, ladies and gentlemen, is to be read, not misread, for that would be a perversion of the genuine concerns to uphold essential principles in which it is rooted. The opposite of this would be to encourage violence and threaten the peace which is contrary to the safety and democracy that the Mozambicans are entitled to win for themselves every day.
costep_2002-09-03_2_124	Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me express my gratitude to the Commission for the initiative that they launched at the end of August, inaugurated by a visit to the affected areas and then by last week’s special session of the Commission to fire the starting shot for the creation of the legal basis for aid to deal with this grave calamity. Let me specifically mention in this connection Commissioner Fischler, who has rather less of a problem with budgets. Not only does he have to make proposals, but he can at the same time take decisions via the Austrian Upper House. It is a great help to the farmers affected by the floods that this has been done so quickly in the aftermath of the events. Three things are needed. Firstly, we must make emergency aid available, and do so quickly. To do so is an expression of European solidarity. I will deliberately emphasise that this must be quick and, indeed, immediate. It will not be enough for people in the affected regions to be sitting in houses and dwellings that they have laboriously decorated, having put up a rough-and-ready Christmas tree, while we in this House are still discussing issues such as legal bases, reallocations and more of the same old thing. Rapid emergency aid means that the procedure by which we act must be the speediest available - we in the PPE group propose that this be based on the procedure used in the 2002 Fourth Supplementary Budget - so that, by the end of October at the latest, funds of the order of EUR 1 billion can be on their way. Secondly, the legal circumstances need to be created. The Structural Fund - Michel Barnier has been mentioned - the law on subsidies and public procurement; all this has to be taken into consideration. What we have to implement here is a complete package of legislation, in order that European law does not stand in the way of rapid reconstruction. Thirdly, we have to equip ourselves to face the future. How can we set up a disaster fund for the future? That is the question. We ought to do that calmly and unhurriedly, in order to get everything right in budgetary and legal terms. If we do these three things, aid will get to people fast, and Europe will discharge its long-term responsibilities to its people.
costep_1998-05-12_6_17	Mr President, this directive is unsound for three reasons. The first of these is its legal basis. As all the previous speakers have demonstrated, this initiative is based on the risks of tobacco addiction for health and thus this directive should have Article 129 of the Treaty as its legal basis. This article allows only for measures of encouragement rather than binding measures of harmonization, and so the directive could not have been presented in its current form. The Commission thus chose Article 100a as the legal basis, that is, harmonization of the single market. But the directive is absurd since, on the one hand, it wants to remove all barriers to competition whilst, on the other, it allows each country to implement the provisions of the directive either immediately or not until the year 2006. If the market needs to be harmonized, then all the countries must be put on an equal footing and we cannot thus ban the sponsorship of sports and cultural events by the tobacco industry in one country whilst a neighbouring country still permits it. This is, in itself, a distortion of competition and the ultimate irony is that it is a directive which is allowing this. Secondly, as regards the substance, it is not acceptable to ban the advertisement of a product which is freely available for sale and which, moreover, is authorized and financed by the European Union. Thirdly, there is complete chaos and total hypocrisy within the European Union with regard to the fight against addiction. Tobacco advertising is cracked down on ferociously, smokers are endlessly bullied, and yet at the same time many Member States, including my own, show laxity in the fight against drugs by authorizing individual consumption even, and especially, amongst the young. So it is dangerous to smoke a cigarette but to smoke a joint is evidently good for your health. In reality, this directive is riding the waves of fashion and easy virtue. It is time that the Commission had the courage to define a reasonable and appropriate policy for fighting addiction in all Member States. As it stands, this directive authorizes nothing but disorder in sporting events over the next six years. My own region, which is the home of the Francorchamps circuit, will feel the full force of the disastrous economic consequences of this directive and, what is even more serious, as statistics from countries where tobacco advertising is banned show, tobacco consumption will not be reduced. It will thus be a failure both economically and in terms of public health.
costep_2000-03-15_4_4	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to reinforce the protection of human rights in the European Union, we must firstly concern ourselves with the most vulnerable, i.e. essentially, the poorest. The most basic violation of human rights is the denial of each individual’s right to live decently. Respect for human dignity must be our guide. We must ensure that poverty is not allowed to destroy individuals and families, that children are not taken away from their parents because of poverty and that the simple right of association is not refused to those who do not even have the right to work. The aim is to create acceptable living conditions for all. Everyone must be protected from poverty and exclusion. Everyone is entitled to education, culture and health. Everyone is entitled to decent housing and an income which allows them to live honourably. We must declare that poverty will not be tolerated. We must declare that everyone is entitled to their physical and mental integrity and that this integrity involves the right to a decent life. Could the idea of fraternity become the key concept for the 21st century? Everyone has in them the enduring need to dream and through fraternity we could meet our main expectations for the poorest in society. Fraternity gives meaning to solidarity, rejects exclusion and solitude, and ensures respect for differences. Fraternity must guarantee the rights of the poorest. Our century will be a century of progress in which the wildest utopian ideals may be realised. Fraternity is one of these ideals and together, ladies and gentlemen, we can achieve it.
costep_2007-05-22_8_11	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the negotiation of the economic partnership agreements between the Commission and the ACP countries is giving rise to the deepest concerns among these countries and is taking place in a climate that is incompatible with the historical partnership relationship that unites us. Europe is perceived as seeking to impose at any price free trade areas on countries that are among the poorest in the world, and under its conditions. The relationship of trust with the ACP countries is now at stake. We must re-open the negotiations on new foundations so as to address the concerns raised in the ACP countries concerning the impact of the EPAs on the future of their economies, many sectors of which could not withstand the lowering of customs protections or a situation in which they face uncontrolled competition with the European economy. The Commission must revert to the principles laid down in the Cotonou Agreement. The aim is development, not reciprocity when it comes to opening up markets. Such a principle would be at odds with the aim set, given the inequalities in development that will not disappear in 20 years' time. Thus, these countries must have the opportunity to choose between an EPA and another form of preferential agreement. We must offer those who have not signed an EPA by the end of 2007 market access that is at least equal to the preferences from which they benefit now, with none of them having to find themselves back in a more unfavourable situation at the end of the agreements. Furthermore, services and the Singapore issues should not be included in the negotiations. The only obligation in terms of compliance with the WTO rules concerns the preferences granted for trade in goods. These issues were taken out of the negotiations within the WTO, at the request of the developing countries. They should not be re-introduced suddenly for the ACP countries. These issues are first and foremost the responsibility of the regional groupings of the ACP countries, whose sovereignty should be respected in this matter. The Commission must therefore withdraw them from the negotiations. Furthermore, the parliaments of the ACP countries and the European Parliament, together with civil society, must have access to all the elements of the negotiations and must be consulted and involved as they take place. Finally, if longer deadlines are needed in order to do a proper job of negotiating good economic partnership agreements, then the Commission must demonstrate flexibility and defend the principle of this before the members of the WTO.
costep_1999-09-16_7_6	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we perhaps have to remind ourselves that much has happened in Russia: over 5 000 nuclear warheads have been withdrawn from use, democratic institutions have been created, and the media there may criticise the government, and, in fact, dare to. It is true the media is more and more passing into the hands of the few, the very people who, as the previous speaker reminded us, have acquired common property for themselves. At the same time, however, we must remember that Russia’s leaders are primarily and directly responsible to their own people, the Russians themselves. I would like to raise the issue of this ruthless campaign of terror and bombing - the most recent explosion took place yesterday evening. The intention of this action is to create instability in the whole area, for the whole vast region, and it is happening at a very awkward time. Russia has two elections in the near future, the situation is very tense, the country has a sick president, and the whole economy is in difficulties. We must condemn, as we are now doing, those states that are aiding the terrorists in their aim to create new instability in a region where there is enough of it as it is. We should not speak of a financial crisis in Russia, however. Russia has a political crisis, and that has continued since the country changed direction. We can certainly see the reasons for this political crisis, but the situation will not be remedied with money, however much of it you heap on Russia. We have seen how things go with money: they go fairly badly. With regard to the West, I would really like to bring up another issue. We still have no clear policy on Russia, although we have a bulky agreement on partnership and co-operation. We have practised collaboration in many ways and we support democracy and civil society in Russia, but, for all that, we do not understand Russia. One reason for that is, in practice, we do not know the Russian politicians very well. We have concentrated on one person, or one body of people, in fact, on one narrow group of people in power. As a consequence, what happens in Russia always takes us by surprise. We should therefore broaden the scope of our political contact with Russia, and, this would help us to understand the changes that take place there so unexpectedly. We know that our financial aid and food aid have pretty much slipped into the hands of those for whom it was not intended. It is the Russian elite that are guilty of this, a group we have had no hold on. I think we should discover how, for example, the competition for transporting food aid granted to Russia by Europe was organised. I perceived problems there, and I would ask the Commission to give an explanation of this affair. In this situation, however, it is necessary to increase co-operation with Russia, and not terminate it. The Northern Dimension, medical care, the Nordic regions, etc, will all be important. Now Russia needs from us very concrete proposals on co-operation, and that is why I regard the aspect of the Northern Dimension as so important, and I hope the Commission will act.
costep_1998-10-23_3_15	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the comments made by the rapporteur and earlier speakers: of course public libraries will continue to occupy a key role in social and information policy in the information society of tomorrow. We should continue to remind people of this, just as we should continue to call for libraries to retain their role of providing greater democracy and political education, for access to them to be free for everyone - this is a very important point - and for quality to remain high in rural areas too. That is why in the discussion on the Directive on copyright, it was right to insist that libraries should be granted generous copyrights. In contrast to the previous speaker, I would like to emphasise two points in particular. Libraries also have to assume new roles. Looking at our own patch for example, public libraries could be much more involved as independent bodies providing information on the European Union. I would point to the very well organised network of Public Information Relays in the UK, which link up public libraries specifically offering EU information. I hope that as we decentralise the public relations work of the EU, we can also induce libraries to take some of it on. I also think libraries could already be doing more in terms of acting as transfer points in communicating contemporary European culture. In practical terms, this could be by way of mutual consultation, by acquiring books and videos from other countries and by directly exchanging stocks of books and multi-media publications with libraries in other countries. This would be an important step, in keeping with the spirit of openness and tolerance. I think that lending libraries could also quite easily be small Internet centres for schoolchildren and young persons who want to build up small communication networks on European culture, and here of course it is important that access to the networks for educational purposes is free of charge. Finally, allow me to make one brief point: if libraries are to continue to offer reasonably-priced access to the cultural wealth provided by books, then in some language areas the tried and tested means of price fixing will be essential to protect the diversity of what is on offer. I ask you: should only paperback American bestsellers be available in European libraries in the future? So, I would really urge the Commission not to sink into its dogma of liberalisation and competition, which is not in the citizen’s interest, but to give greater thought to private methods of selfregulation in future decisions.
costep_1998-05-02_4_62	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not voting in the same way as the rest of my group as I personally believe that, at this historic stage, none of the issues involved in the single currency amounts to a real question of conscience and so, in my capacity as an MEP who has always flown the flag of the Europe of the nations and the Europe of the regions, I am bound to welcome the advent of the single currency, the first great and real push against the sovereignty of the centralist nation states who are opposed to any autonomy. For me, this represents the fulfilment of a commitment solemnly entered into between me and the electors of Piedmont, Val d'Aosta, Liguria and Lombardy, who genuinely believe in the reasoning behind political and cultural autonomy. This is my justification of my personal vote in favour of the proposal, which is at odds with the declaration made by the spokesman for my group.
costep_2003-03-11_2_223	Mr President, proactive and resolute leadership is needed on economic policy at the EU’s spring summit. We cannot go on trotting out the same old formulae. Unfortunately they fall far short of what is required at a difficult time, which is not only characterised by an economic downturn but also, regrettably, by the shadows that an approaching war is casting over economic and employment policy. That is why Parliament’s reports - and I mean all of those on the table this evening - show a glimmer of hope but at the same time make demands that mercilessly expose the weaknesses in the European economy. I should like to underline that it is out of the question to eliminate a Stability and Growth Pact that has been created to bring order to the economy. Instead we need to apply it taking into account the Lisbon objectives in a time and a place and in such a way that it makes sense, because the people of Europe deserve no less. I think that we need to make every effort to halt the economic slide. We cannot deny either that even the European Central Bank is now talking about risks of a downward trend in the European Union. This means that we need to pursue a proactive policy and to that extent the repeated references to structural reforms do not serve any purpose either. Besides, we do not yet know what economic benefits these structural reforms will bring to the European Union and we have no idea what impact they will have on employment policy. Economic institutes, national ministries and also the Commission have not answered this question. But we need this answer to know which direction is the right one. I believe that the saying still holds true: employment creates growth, but growth also creates employment. We have to work on the basis of real growth and not only on the basis of potential for growth. I should like to point out once more that it is absolutely right - as the reports also state - for us to refer repeatedly to the lack of investment in both the private and public sectors. We are not honouring the Lisbon agreement about 3% growth. Neither are we respecting the agreement to invest more in research and development, and that too applies to both the private and public sectors. Japan and the USA are streets ahead of us in both respects. At the moment we perhaps do not really need an economic government, but coordination up and across our governments, coordination that is worthy of the name, is in the interests of growth and employment.
costep_1999-04-14_5_9	Mr President, I would like to thank the draftsmen of this report as well as the Commission and in particular Commissioner Bonino for the excellent cooperation we have managed to establish in this area, since thanks to Parliament’s action and the constructive rather than destructive response to it we have identified the problem and tried over the years to resolve it in the best possible way. We have separated out the sectors and made major progress. Today we acknowledge - and we are right to make a point of this - that the action the Commission is taking has not yet managed to overcome the resistance of the Member States. The fact that 13 out of 15 countries are not fully implementing the recommendations which they should implement goes to show that we need to carry on working with the Commission to achieve this objective, so that respecting and safeguarding consumers really does become Union policy.
costep_1997-06-12_3_7	Mr President, we Greens believe that in order not to compromise SOCRATES, which was originally designed to meet the needs of only 12 Member States, it is now essential to increase the funds allocated for its implementation. The growing number of applications under the programme and, above all, the involvement of 11 new countries as from 1998, require an increase in the budget in order to ensure reciprocal mobility between the European Union and the associated countries. The Commission’s proposed budget increase of 5.9 % is utterly inadequate and takes no account either of real demand or of the extension of the programme to cover the associated countries. We would not wish the success of SOCRATES to be jeopardized; nor would we wish it to benefit only those who can afford to foot the bill for their stay in the host country. For this reason, the Greens strongly support the request by Mrs Pack: we are calling for a substantial increase in funding, so as to send a positive signal to the educational community and to public opinion.
costep_2001-12-11_11_6	Madam President, we view with concern the decisions of the meeting of the World Trade Organisation. Its repercussions in the short and medium term may prove disastrous for the peoples of many countries, particularly the less developed countries, but also some in the European Union, namely Portugal. For my country, the opening up in the agricultural and textile areas, including the bilateral agreements being negotiated by the European Union, such as that with Pakistan, without taking Portuguese requirements into account, is particularly worrying. For the economic and multinational groups, the most important factor was achieved: the opening of negotiations for greater liberalisation of world trade, postponed in Seattle and openly called into question this year by world organisations, namely those which were present at the World Social Forum of Porto Alegre and at Genoa. The triumphant declarations of UNICE (European employers' organisation) show this clearly when they state that the principal issue was settled, even if not all its demands were fully satisfied. The final resolution of the WTO itself, referring to liberalisation in particularly sensitive areas such as textiles, important aspects of agriculture, services and others, including the area of intellectual property, leaves little doubt, although its consolidation in practice could yet be influenced by any disputes that may develop. Even a few small positive advances in the field of intellectual property, after the pressure which countries like Brazil and South Africa brought to bear in order to obtain generic drugs to combat AIDS and malaria, show that it is important to step up the fight against capitalist globalisation in its various aspects, whether political, economic, social or environmental. The European Union trade associations have already condemned the opening of negotiations within the WTO framework without at least having secured real progress in upholding compliance with the ILO agreements and minimum standards of defence of workers' rights, given that there can be no sustained development without social and environmental development. The liberalisation of international trade favours the rich countries and multinationals, deepens the gulf between developed and less developed countries, as is clearly shown by studies conducted under the aegis of the UN, intensifies the exploitation of communities and workers by multinationals which dominate international trade and which are only interested in making maximum profit, even if it is at the expense of child labour, food safety, the environment, family farming and multifunctional farming. Hence the importance of mobilising support for the fight for an alternative of sustained development which places priority on reducing poverty and social expansion, which promotes a review of the CAP, which is more coherent, which provides more mutual support and which is less isolated from the countries of the South.
costep_2011-05-11_6_530	This report on 'The EU as a global actor: its role in multilateral organisations' presents an overview of the role of the EU. I voted in favour of this report as I agree with its vision and ambition for an EU that has a strong presence on the international stage. Apart from the value of each Member State per se, the EU, as an organisation, can contribute its organisational experience to the international community. Indeed, the EU’s mechanisms for building consensus and taking concerted action make it a model for a rules-based international order. In view of this, cooperation with the leading regional powers should be encouraged, so that the EU can actively participate in the building and improvement of an international environment that enables the EU to promote its values and interests, as required by the Treaty. With regard to the EU’s aspiration to be a global player, it is therefore essential to strengthen internal coordination in order to speak with one voice. This is the only way to achieve multilateral cooperation and address international challenges, namely those arising from the responsibility to protect, and the need to enhance human security as a means of achieving global security.
costep_2009-01-13_9_59	Mrs Grabrowska’s report recommends permanent dialogue between all the European institutions and the 'representatives' from civil society to define policies and draw up legislation at EU level, in other words a formal, compulsory organisation of participatory 'democracy' at Union level. The trouble is, participatory 'democracy' is merely a front for those who reject true democracy: it allows dialogue to be restricted to the most active organisations, which are rarely the most representative, and it appears to test citizens' views in advance, the better to be able to refuse to consult them properly later on. If the Europe of Brussels wishes to hear the citizens, let it take note of the French and Dutch 'no' to the European Constitution and abandon the Treaty of Lisbon, which is a mere copy of the Constitution. If opinion polls ought to be taken into account, as the rapporteur would like, put a stop to the negotiations for Turkey’s membership, because the majority of Europe’s citizens oppose it. If it is right to respect the principle that decisions should be taken as close as possible to the citizens, let Europe cease to rule over our daily lives. Then it would have some credibility when it spoke of democracy.
costep_1997-03-12_7_10	Mr President, the Barcelona Conference marked a major turning point in the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean pole. That in no way reduces the necessity to conduct a regular review of progress in the working areas that have been opened up, to ensure that the spirit of Barcelona endures. And, as Mr Sakellariou’s excellent report recommends, it is important that the European Union should move further down the road to Euro-Mediterranean co-operation. As far as my group is concerned, it seems to us fundamental to strengthen trade relations while adopting the objective of reducing the trade balance deficit. Furthermore, sustainable development of these regions presupposes sound management of resources, and especially of water. Politically, we would like to see some relaxation of the common policies of conflict prevention, and greater attention paid to the subject of human rights. Nevertheless, the spirit of Barcelona will only be fully realized if culture is given the importance that was attached to it at the time of the Conference, as a catalyst and as a means for bringing peoples closer together and combating intolerance and racism. That is why my group will be supporting the amendments designed to strengthen cultural exchanges, the role of civilian society and the heritage conservation policies.
costep_2010-11-24_6_12	Mr President, the European Council meeting was marked by expectations of how Europe’s leaders would deal with the problems presented to them by the economic recession. As I have said many times now, it is not enough to focus only on budgets. The structural imbalances which the crisis has only exacerbated go beyond debts. Unless a mechanism is adopted which will be capable of affecting the other aspects as well, there must be serious doubts as to its success. Another topic was the debate over whether the budget fallout caused by pension reforms would lead to a deficit. On the one hand we are talking about tightening up the rules and making them more systematic, but then we immediately make exemptions. Also, if pension reforms are as essential as they are made out to be, which I personally do not believe they are, other examples of successful programmes could also be found. Who will then assess which is more and which is less important, and why? I firmly believe that we must not launch a debate on exemptions at the same time as talking about system changes.
costep_2009-12-15_16_10	I would like to thank Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and especially Cecilia Malmström, who is currently among us as a minister but is soon to be a commissioner as well. I would also like first to briefly express my sincere thanks for the report, which contained some very important information. Please also allow me to say that since the last two enlargement rounds, the European Union’s eastern neighbours have, in fact, moved very close to the European Union, which is a valuable development from numerous perspectives, not only because of the geographical proximity, but partly because of a foreign policy based on the idea of spheres of Russian influence, not to mention the increased importance of energy security. From this perspective, the Eastern Partnership programme is of paramount importance, as it can also ensure differentiation, yet it still clearly establishes closer ties with these countries. Georgia is the country in the Caucasus region which is most committed to the European Union’s values. I would like to mention and emphasise a couple of matters, starting with the preparations for the visa facilitation process. This measure is not only important from a human relations perspective, but it is also important because we know that South Ossetian and Abkhazian citizens who are Russian passport holders are already enjoying the benefits of this, which has created such tension that this is only aggravating the situation further. The second matter I would like to stress is that there are unresolved conflicts in four of the countries which come under the Eastern Neighbourhood policy, something we must give our fullest attention to. Finally, I would like to thank Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for all the efforts she has made to bring this region closer to the European Union.
costep_2008-07-07_15_33	Mr President, I too am pleased to welcome the French Presidency, with the French minister Mr Jouyet among us. It is true that it is unusual for the Presidency to be here on a Monday, even during these questions. I will indeed be talking about the deployment of the police, the riot police, in front of Parliament today. When I arrived earlier, I went through two riot police cordons. I wondered what could be posing such a threat to Parliament that such an armada of riot police should be deployed. Twice I had to state my identity; I was asked why I was in the area of the European Parliament. I was really very surprised, Mr Jouyet, because I do not feel threatened here and, on the contrary, I feel rather oppressed by all these barriers. I would like to remind you that surrounding the house of the European people with riot police is a strange way to begin the French Presidency and I am keen to point out that we want this house to remain a house of the people, open to citizens.
costep_1999-12-14_3_23	Mr President, who actually persuaded whom to extend candidate status for membership of the EU to Turkey, at the end of last week? The Council together with the Commission or the applicant themselves? The diplomatic urgent mission undertaken by Messrs Solana and Verheugen points towards an interesting answer to this question. It is a state of affairs that indicates very clearly how strained mutual relations between Athens and Ankara still are. Indeed it was above all Greek pre-conditions in respect of Turkey’s candidacy - think of the Cyprus question and border disputes in the Aegean Sea in particular - that prompted Messrs Solana and Verheugen to hurriedly take to the air in the direction of Prime Minister Ecevit. And rumour has it that it was only because of American intervention that the Turkish coalition government eventually accepted the European promotion. Who in Europe actually has cause to be pleased at this odd approach? Particularly now that Prime Minister Ecevit is going to stick to his guns regarding the political division of Cyprus, not to mention one of the most crucial, implicit accession requirements for Turkey: voluntary renunciation on the part of the country’s formidable military apparatus of its considerable political power. Anyhow, it is characteristic of the situation that Prime Minister Ecevit rightly pointed to the great geo-strategic importance of his fatherland vis-à-vis the West. An argument that certainly gains force in the light of Russia’s barbaric, imperial pacification tactics in Chechnya. However, it is for NATO alone, not the European Union, to secure military balance and counterbalance in the turbulent Caucasus region. We count amongst the positive results of the Summit the fact that candidate status for membership of the EU was accepted for five more Eastern European States and the Council’s statement, or rather its clear exhortation to Russia’s political leaders. Sadly enough, ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, ten years after the spectacular revolution in Central and Eastern Europe, fear of Moscow continues to cause the nations of this region to seek security and economic prosperity in the West. This state of affairs is every bit as deserving of Mr Solana and a European Commissioner undertaking an urgent mission to the Kremlin.
costep_1998-12-15_5_14	Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to add our appreciation to that already expressed for the rapporteur, Bárbara Dührkop. The Committee on Fisheries has collaborated with the general working party for the 1999 budget during the various stages of the budgetary procedure, mainly through the original draftsman for the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Apolinario, who is no longer a Member of this Parliament. Although the only amendment tabled by the Committee on Fisheries is an amendment proposing a slight increase in appropriations for monitoring actions, we would like to take this opportunity to repeat a series of priorities that form the core of the committee’s actions. I will list them in no special order: firstly, actions that monitor actual compliance with Community rules; secondly, specific actions in the areas of non-industrial and inshore fishing; thirdly, research, which is closely linked to the development of the fifth framework programme; fourthly, the Structural Funds, an issue we have already discussed on many occasions; and finally, the question of international agreements, which I would like to consider for a moment. As far as international agreements are concerned, the appropriations proposed for the 1999 financial year are lower than those for 1998, both in commitment appropriations and in payment appropriations. Undoubtedly, there is justification for this reduction, but we would like to make an important point here. The Committee on Fisheries would draw the attention of the authorities to the difficulty that will arise, when preparing the budget for 2000, in relation to the agreement with Morocco. This runs out on 30 November 1999 and costs EUR 120 million every year, practically half of the total for this heading. The budgetary authority will have to show its capacity for sound management in order to ensure that the necessary budgetary appropriations are available to implement a new agreement, while remaining discrete about this amount so as not to endanger the negotiations with Morocco.
costep_2007-02-01_4_13	Mr President, a Government Procurement Agreement could mean more transparency and thus less corruption. It could also mean fair prices - which is not unimportant given that public service contracts involve taxpayers' money - with the right, though, to include social and environmental criteria at the tendering stage. Developing countries could also benefit enormously from all these advantages. Needless to say, their participation in the international Government Procurement Agreement in future cannot be ruled out, but the Commission should ensure that they can implement this method - and the same applies to fair competition rules - nationally or regionally at first, just as we did in Europe, and do not need, therefore, to allow in the entire world and the large monopolies straight away. It would then have to be up to the developing countries to determine when they would feel sufficiently developed. Something that, in fact, applies the world over, is that forced large-scale tenders, as a result of which the small and medium-sized enterprises are pushed out of the market, should be avoided at all costs. Unfortunately, I have first-hand experience of exactly that at a train station in Amsterdam where the train station’s security service was put out to tender. The company that was previously responsible for the station’s security was a small company and was doing an excellent job. During tender, however, this company proved too small to compete for the total tender for many of those stations and was elbowed out of the market, therefore. My fellow Members have undoubtedly come across similar examples, and that is why we would like to ask the Commission how the SMEs can be guaranteed better access to procurement contracts. Finally, the forced break-up of the national and semi-public provisions for the sake of large foreign suppliers is fundamentally wrong. Every country has the right to regulate publicly what the public would like to retain. We are talking about basic provisions here, like education and water, provisions that are at the heart of society and that should not be messed with.
costep_2008-05-21_11_8	Europe should offer China as much support as possible, for both humanitarian and political reasons. I am one of the very many Members of this House who are strongly opposed to China’s barbaric policy towards Tibet and towards Christians. I believe we should react very forcefully indeed to any instance of aggression towards Taiwan. On the other hand, however, we must take advantage of every opportunity to show the Chinese people that the demands we are making of their leaders are not motivated by any feeling of enmity towards their country and its traditions. We must prove that friendly partnership is possible, and an excellent opportunity to do so has now arisen. We should offer extensive assistance to the victims and commit ourselves wholeheartedly to reconstruction work following the recent disaster. It would be a great mistake to miss this opportunity of building trust between Europe and China.
costep_2010-12-13_18_14	Madam President, I have now been in Parliament for a year and I have dealt with various dossiers, but none of them have been as difficult as what we have on the table here. At this point, I would like to offer my sincere thanks once again to Mrs Mathieu and Mr Cercas, the two rapporteurs from the relevant committees. This really is a very difficult matter, and the reason for this is that naturally we have very high ideals in Europe. We want to treat everyone who lives and works here fairly and equally. That, in principle, is something we can all agree on as a starting point. However, the question remains as to how much we can really implement this in detail. We have already been reminded that with the Treaty of Lisbon, we now wish to draw up a common policy on asylum and migration. Asylum policy is something close to our hearts, and not just because of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We also need a migration policy for economic reasons, because demographic changes are taking place and we have a very urgent need not just for highly qualified workers, but also for less skilled workers. Basically, the great difficulty here is what to do. As has already been said - Mrs in 't Veld mentioned it - the Member States stated back in 1990 in Tampere that they wanted to develop a common structure. Nothing has yet been placed on the table. In other words, what we have today is a compromise - we are not completely happy with it, but in my view, it is a way for us to move forward. Speaking personally, I can well understand why some are saying that we need more time for discussion. I am not completely happy with it either. It is particularly important to me, for example, that everyone should have access to training and further education, because this is absolutely crucial - not just for the persons concerned, so that they can work in the labour market, but also for us with our real need for workers. In the case of social security, for example, where we already have so many different systems anyway that have not even been harmonised within the EU, it raises the question of how we can really create a common set of rights for third country nationals in all cases even if we want to. It is difficult, and that is why I see the compromise that is currently on the table as a good thing. We really should vote in favour; then at least we will have something.
costep_2000-04-14_5_5	Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate you on the way you handled the debate this morning. You encountered a storm and weathered it without the help of the Commission. But Commissioner, I would also like, and I feel that this is essential, the institutions of the European Union to bear witness to the solidarity which unites the Member States, in particular in the event of exceptional disasters such as the storms of 26 December last which caused such unprecedented damage to a number of forest regions in France, Germany and Austria. There is an urgent need for us to begin using the instruments available to the Union to assist the affected regions and support the individuals and companies concerned. The need for our support is all the more pressing given that transportation, storage and forest exploitation cannot be delayed without serious consequences in terms of both the quality of the products and the restoration and protection of forest ecosystems. Thus, in the Alsace region alone, more than 6.5 million cubic metres of woodland has been devastated, which is essentially equivalent to one to three years' harvests. Clearly, the influx of timber onto the market will send prices plummeting and so further damage the industry’s economic operators. Once again, the way that the sector is structured may facilitate the search for joint solutions between the upstream operators which manage forestry resources and the downstream operators which exploit them. The inter-trade system introduced in France can certainly play a major part in the search for, and development of, these joint solutions. Indeed, since they are designed not to protect the interests of any one section of the industry, they facilitate the protection of the industry as a whole, promote the timber sector and ensure respect for the great internal balances which make it possible to consolidate the whole. Although regional in scale, inter-trade bodies also have a local impact and are immediately efficacious in critical situations such as that of our forestry companies and the timber industry. We should therefore favour direct contacts with potential partners, even more so given that inter-trade bodies are also the consultative partners of local governments and national authorities with regard to defining forestry policies and hence with regard to the search for immediate solutions to crises. They are also able to identify bottlenecks in the implementation of safeguard programmes. This is why I ask you not to disregard direct consultation with the industry’s operators in your consultation mechanism. Moreover, regulations can be a constraint which varies according to the State in question, as is, notably, the case with regard to grain storage, in respect of the impermeability of the ground, the water sampling limits, which are set at 5% of the low water discharge in France and 30% in Germany and waste disposal monitoring. I therefore feel that exceptional measures should also be implemented. The scale of the disaster shows that the aid pledged by the State or confirmed at local level will not be sufficient to cover the damage reported. It is therefore essential to be able to draw on the Structural Funds to finance special measures for forests and the timber industry in the case of disasters in objective 2 or former objective 5b areas. The same applies to rural development measures and other, more specific, economic or environmental programmes, in parallel with actions for using up workable timber, which represents about 50% of the windfall. It would also be desirable to promote incentive measures for using the poorer quality wood for energy production. However, the urgency of the situation calls for flexible, simplified procedures to financially supplement the provisions already introduced by the Member States I therefore call upon the Commission to seek consensus with the industry as a whole and the Member States concerned in order to find effective, immediate solutions, for the greater the consensus, the more effective the solutions will be.
costep_2010-02-25_5_18	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the recent rail accident in Brussels, which many Members have mentioned, the spotlight has once again been on the safety of the railways. Directive 2004/49/EC on safety of the railways in general stipulates that railway undertakings and infrastructure managers should bear the full responsibility for the safety of the system, each for their own part. In the specific case of the accident that occurred in Belgium, human error seems to have been the cause. We shall, of course, await the investigations. It would appear, however, that the train was not fitted with an automatic braking system. Is the Commission aware of which networks and which trains within the Member States are not fitted with this safety device? Moreover, does it intend to draft a legislative proposal so as to ensure that the Union’s entire network is fitted with this system?
costep_2004-10-13_1_61	Mr President, the situation in the Middle East appears to be one of complete deadlock. Arafat is there in his headquarters - old, isolated, in poor health and unable to lead his people. Sharon fails again and again in his plan to withdraw from Gaza. He appears to have lost touch with both his party and the electorate. The question is that of whether he is the man who can lead Israel to peace. I do not believe he is. The future of the Gaza plan is now extremely uncertain, and violence in the area appears to be increasing. It is worse than it has been for a very long time. I do not believe that these gentlemen can bring about lasting peace in the Middle East. They cannot put an end to the killing. They cannot put an end to the violence and the acts of terrorism, and they cannot bring about what all of us in this House want to see: two states living peacefully side by side and with respect for one another. This conflict has gone on for so many decades and has involved so much suffering, for the Palestinian people, of course, but also for the Israeli people, who live in constant fear of acts of terrorism and of suicide bombs. We have made so many plans, had so many conferences and meetings and held so many debates in this House, but nothing happens. We must consider having a practical international presence in the region that can supervise the withdrawal from Gaza and perhaps also remain there in the longer term. Following the American presidential election, and no matter who wins, the EU and the United States must sit down and formulate a common strategy, based perhaps upon the road map, in which they talk the same language and give out the same signals to these two leaders. The whole world stands to gain from peace in the Middle East, and it is also an important part of the fight against international terrorism.
costep_2011-02-02_14_9	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the most recent reports from the southern Mediterranean and Egypt state that shots are being fired in Cairo. The situation is coming to a head. As a result of this news, I can only appeal to the European Heads of State or Government not to wait until lunch time on Friday of this week to agree on what the right message for Egypt should be. It is long overdue for us to make it clear to Mr Mubarak that he has to stand down swiftly, this being necessary in order to prevent this unrest in Egypt from escalating further and to ensure that developments follow a similar path to those previously seen in Tunisia. It would be really disgraceful if we were to simply wait to see what happens in Egypt. Applause This summit is actually supposed to be an energy summit. However, when I see the preparations that are being made for it, I am actually not surprised that other topics are now setting the agenda. On the basis of the slogan 'we need security of energy supply', a lot of contact - by you in particular, Mr Barroso - is being made with countries like Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. Mr Oettinger recently spoke in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy about how we are going to develop our energy relations with Iraq, Georgia and Turkmenistan. In view of the events in the southern Mediterranean, where we are also seeing the consequences of our policies relating to our own interests and our external energy policy, I consider this to be rather hazardous. I know we need diversification because we also face a problematic and very difficult situation to the east with Russia and the transit countries of Belarus and Ukraine. However, diversification must not involve us now entering into relations with despots and countries in crisis. Energy efficiency and renewable energies are the solution for a better and more secure energy supply, and I have to say, Mr Barroso, you have tolerated a great deal in this regard. Mr Oettinger has neglected the area that was managed well by Mr Piebalgs, or - and this is the negative way of looking at it - he has once again chosen not to promote future-proof technologies such as renewable energies and energy efficiency and has reverted to the old energy mix. Suddenly we find that feed-in tariffs for nuclear power stations, for atomic energy, are to be discussed at the summit - good grief, where do we actually stand in this modernisation and innovation debate? I have simply lost patience with this now. Applause Perhaps we have actually been too patient where economic governance is concerned. Germany now seems to be following the Schäuble course. However, what we currently have on the table still does not represent the state of the art. We need more than a minor amendment to the stability instrument. We urgently need to take a decision to amend the credit conditions for Greece and Ireland or we will end up destroying these countries. We need more money in the crisis instrument, otherwise we can forget any ideas of providing assistance to Spain and Portugal in the near future. What we need at long last - just so that we understand each other very clearly on this point - is a proposal for how we intend to deal with the restructuring of debt. We cannot avoid it, everyone knows that, and we, as Parliament, also want to discuss it further here.
costep_2010-04-21_5_10	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I take this opportunity to highlight the legitimacy of your point that the European Parliament must not forget, either, the role and the importance of the Italian language, of the use of the Italian language, which has contributed so much to European culture. Returning to the subject at hand, it must be said that, ultimately, after that standstill pursued strongly by the European Parliament, which, on this occasion, seemed perhaps not to have fully appreciated the urgent, dramatic need not to undermine in any way, for any reason, a fundamental requirement of the West and of Europe, that of defending itself from terrorism. Of course, it is absolutely true that there has to be a balance, a proportionality, that citizens' rights and privacy rights must not be sacrificed beyond measure and that the possibility for citizens to lodge an appeal, either an administrative appeal or a legal appeal, against any decisions taken on the basis of the SWIFT system must, of course, be guaranteed - just as this new wording by the Commission, which has accepted many of the most important points made by the European Parliament, guarantees. Therefore, in my view, the guidelines in the negotiating mandate adopted by the Commission on SWIFT should be regarded as essentially sound, in terms of ensuring, I repeat, effective and necessary cooperation with the US authorities as regards the tracking of financial transactions to combat and prevent the terrorist threat - this, of course, being in the bilateral interest, since Europe, too, must remember that it needs to defend itself from terrorism; we have seen too much obvious, and also extremely serious, evidence of terrorism - and of ensuring the democratic control of the data flow entrusted to the European Parliament, which is thus the most reliable form of protection there can be for European citizens' personal data and the protection of their right to assert themselves in all appropriate forums. The mandate also takes on board many suggestions offered by us MEPs, and this speaks volumes for the importance of the European Parliament and for the new role granted to it by the treaty. Furthermore, we must remember that the agreement provides for reciprocity from the United States should the European Union succeed in launching a European terrorist finance tracking programme. Europe must swing into action - in any case, it must not always trail behind - it must swing into action and must itself provide vital input and information. On the PNR system, which will be discussed later, the same logic applies: a passenger recognition measure, once again for the purposes of combating terrorism, is absolutely crucial.
costep_2010-04-21_5_17	In February, we refused to ratify an agreement on processing and transmitting data contained in financial reports for the purposes of a US Treasury programme to monitor terrorism. The reasons for the refusal were clearly listed and they include in particular: breaching the fundamental principles of data protection law for a large number of citizens and subjects of the European Union (up to 90 million data items per month), the absence of protection for EU citizens against the abuse of their data provided under this agreement to the United States and to third countries, and the absence of genuine reciprocity, since the other party to the agreement has not undertaken to provide information of similar quality and scope to the EU. Many of these shortcomings can be eliminated in the new agreement, but the actual principle of a comprehensive transfer of all data from the EU to the US, where the US processes, evaluates and stores all records on EU financial operations without any restriction, under the pretext of looking for links to terrorism, is not tenable. This tenet must be amended. The financial operations of European banks should be processed only under European rules and on European soil. We will hand over to our friends from the United States only those items that really relate to terrorism.
costep_2003-02-13_4_119	Mr President, the worst thing about this situation in Venezuela is that the two sides have stopped talking to each other. Their inability to enter into a dialogue is causing society, and even the State itself to fragment, leaving behind a vacuum that other undemocratic groups are only too eager to fill. At this stage I should therefore like to draw your attention to the fact that an initiative has emerged from the Latin American Parliament and the European Parliament to form a joint group, to establish a dialogue with Members of Parliament on both sides in Venezuela and in this way also to support the efforts of the Group of Friends of Venezuela to bring the two sides together. I hope that it will eventually be possible for us to build this bridge. Incidentally, I suspect that given the current crisis in Iraq, the longer this conflict lasts the more likely it is that the oil involved will lead the United States to call for action to be taken. The fact that well over 10% of America’s oil comes from Venezuela is not without its consequences for them, or for the other countries of Latin America either, because rises in the price of oil are due, at least in part, to the situation in Venezuela. The man in the street in the countries of Latin America is the one who will pay. Apart from getting the two sides talking, what else is to be done? I think that sooner or later we will have no alternative but to let the people decide. Here, though, I think it is important to keep the constitution as a basis, because despite all of its shortcomings the validity of this constitution has not been contested. Latin America’s reputation for not respecting constitutions goes before it. This is all the more reason for us to ensure that where a constitution is actually recognised at international level, we do stick to it. If it is to be amended then it should be with the agreement of both sides to perhaps enable elections to be held at an early stage. But as I see it the only way out seems to be for the people to decide, and no one else!
costep_1998-05-14_3_9	Mr President, in taking the initiative of studying the problem of information in the European institutions, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media has done something worthwhile. However, even though everyone sees the need for it, the actual completion of such a project is not an easy thing. We must thank Mr Pex for having buckled down to the task, and our colleagues from the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media and the Committee on Institutional Affairs for having helped him to avoid certain pitfalls. Nevertheless, whatever false images people may have of Europe and its institutions, it is important to distinguish between information for the citizens and the actual communication policy. Information includes helping our fellow citizens to have a better perception of the European institutions and a greater knowledge of the decisions taken, while communication, in political terms, is the duty of the political groups and the Members of the European Parliament themselves. Our mandate obliges us to learn to pass on the message and to explain our choices. No institutionalized communication policy could replace this. Furthermore, simpler institutions which are easier for people to understand would ease their sometimes conflicting relationship with Europe. This is a question which cannot be evaded, but it goes beyond the scope of this debate. More specifically, with regard to the problem of setting up a permanent working group, my group has reservations. Nevertheless, such a body could not exist without all the political groups being represented. We are therefore voting for the amendments which go in this direction. This is the sine qua non of a true information policy.
costep_1998-09-16_7_13	Mr President, the situation in Kosovo has become more complicated since July. Obviously, those most affected are the refugees, the people who are dying. The situation has also become more complicated politically, not only there but in all the countries surrounding the region. Take the situation in Albania, for example where Berisha is again attempting to subvert the democratic order and put the government against the ropes. It may not have been a very effective government, but it was the government the majority of Albanians wanted. The fact is that, once again, the European Union has been shown to be lacking in muscle. It has not been in the right place, it has been weak, it has failed to act as a body. Initiatives have sprung up all over the place, a whole range of appointments have been made, boycotts set up but not applied - I am not referring to the country which is forever being condemned, it is the United Kingdom which claims that international contractual obligations prevent it from applying the boycott of air transport. What must be done? Pressure on those responsible has be increased. Those responsible are Milosevic and his government, for whom things are not complicated in the least, as they are on their way to getting what they want by fire and the sword. Kosovo must certainly be granted self-determination within a democratic Serbia.
costep_2009-05-04_17_22	Madam President, back in 1817, the socially minded British entrepreneur Robert Owen advocated the introduction of the eight-hour working day. In his view, prosperity for everyone was possible if people worked for eight hours and the work was well organised. Then, exactly 125 years ago, the initial impetus was given for the introduction of the eight-hour working day in the United States. It is one of the democratic convictions of our European community that shortening the working week contributes to a life compatible with human dignity. Fortunately, in recent decades, this has been joined by greater attention to the sharing of work and care responsibilities. Madam President, in this context, it is a great shame that we in Europe are still having to fight to limit the maximum working week. To require workers to systematically work overtime and put in long working weeks is to destroy jobs. Various studies have shown that Robert Owen was right: working longer than eight hours is counterproductive. In these times of growing unemployment, the majority of the Council and the Commission have taken completely the wrong direction.
costep_2003-03-26_3_138	Mr President, I am undeservedly deputising for Mr Nisticò, the rapporteur, who is unable to be here, and I assure Commissioner Liikanen that I will pass on his thanks and compliments. For my fellow Members' information, I will therefore very briefly describe the measure which we will be voting on tomorrow and, as Commissioner Liikanen already said, represents common ground which the Parliamentary delegation to the Conciliation Committee has supported, endorsed and which it commends to the House for a positive vote tomorrow. As Commissioner Liikanen has already said, this is an amendment to the twenty-third amendment of Directive 76/769 relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (substances classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction). The proposal, based on Article 95 of the Treaty, has two main objectives: to safeguard the internal market by introducing harmonised provisions on the marketing and use of the above-mentioned substances and to achieve a high level of protection for human health and the environment. It is appropriate to point out that we are talking about 25 substances in particular, 14 of which are classified as category 2 carcinogens, such as some cobalt salts, cadmium, benzopyrene, azoic colouring agents and so on; three of these are classified as mutagens and eight as toxic to reproduction. For example, it has been established that cobalt causes carcinogenic effects in laboratory animals and in human beings, particularly lung cancer and myocardial tissue tumours; cadmium powders, for their part, can cause testicular cancer in addition to lung cancer. As can therefore be inferred from these brief examples, we are dealing with highly dangerous substances. During the last year and a half to two years of work, Parliament adopted at first reading, in February 2002, two amendments which the Council, in June 2003, partly accepted by adopting its common position. At its second reading in 2002, Parliament adopted an amendment to the recitals. We have therefore reached the final part of this conciliation, of these three stages and, as has already been pointed out, the problem that still needed to be settled did not concern the substances, but the products which may contain these substances. Well, the agreement on the sole point at issue during conciliation stipulates that the Commission must submit as soon as possible a legislative proposal aimed at banning the use of products - products this time - containing substances classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction where, however - and emphasising this is very important to the rapporteur - there is scientific evidence that these substances are released by such products, thereby exposing the general public to the risks described above. This is why the delegation considers the obtained results to be satisfactory for Parliament and commends it to the House for adoption.
costep_2003-03-13_4_65	The 'replacement' of NATO forces with a military force under the ESDP is being presented as the first military operation to have been undertaken under this EU policy, a policy to which we are opposed. This is a military operation that has been executed following the EU/NATO declaration on the ESDP of 16 December 2002, which welcomes 'the strategic partnership established between the European Union and NATO in crisis management, founded on our shared values, the indivisibility of our security and our determination to tackle the challenges of the new Century'. This is a military force, albeit a 'symbolic' one, which can call on the resources and capabilities of NATO and is headed by the Deputy Supreme Commander of this organisation in Europe - a military operation under the ESDP as the European pillar of NATO. This is an attempt to pursue an illegal and illegitimate NATO operation which is consistent with the interference and imperialist aggression inflicted on the Balkans. It is therefore an initial military operation that will open the way to others, with the 'replacement' of NATO forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina being suggested as the next. Hence our vote against the report.
costep_1997-12-16_7_17	Mr President, the fifth framework programme represents a clear step forward in relation the fourth programme. It centres on the priorities and in defining them it takes the interaction between science and society into account. By proposing an increased budget for the next five years, it acknowledges the central role of research in contributing to public well-being, economic development and European competitiveness. I would emphasize, however, that so far as the distribution of the funds between the actions is concerned, the degree of over-concentration on the first action is frightening countries like Portugal. For my country, actions to further international cooperation and better results are still of fundamental importance. It is natural for viewpoints to differ from one Member State to another. The difficulty the last 'Research Council' had in reaching an agreement proves this point. But the widest gaps exist between those countries which favour research and want it concentrated on products for development, and those others, like Portugal, for whom the development and transfer of technology has to be their major preoccupation, together with mobility of research grants; because that is the only way they can be sure of getting their share of the improvement in the efficiency of European research policy. I would like to draw attention to two aspects which I tried to get included in the draft report on the framework programme, one of which was taken up by the Research Committee and the other rejected. The first, which is reflected in the report, is the importance of including socio-economic research in the first action under the Fifth Programme. In the face of Europe’s problems, which keep on getting more complicated, such as racism, xenophobia, unemployment, sustainable development, bio-ethics and public health, the development of the social dimension of research must take priority in our policy. The second is the urgent need to develop a fully integrated marine science and technology policy, which will open the way to a genuine European policy on the oceans. Unfortunately I was unable to get that proposal included. I will conclude, Mr President, while on the subject of my proposals concerning the ocean, by reminding the House that with the Union signing the United Nations Convention on the oceans, the work of the Independent Commission on the Oceans, and Expo 98 in Lisbon, I am sure that a climate is being created in which a full-blown European Oceans Agency will fall into our laps one of these days.
costep_2002-01-17_5_25	The major political obstacle standing in the way of the adoption of this report is the application threshold values of European standards, which are of absolutely crucial economic importance for public works companies, the environment, public finances and infrastructure quality. The crux of the matter, politically speaking, is simple: above what amount, in millions of euro, must a public contract be subjected to Community procedures? There are two conflicting theories, therefore: Those in support of increased threshold values have pointed out that this would avoid administrative costs and cumbersome bureaucratic processes for contracts which will not, in any case, attract international competition. They would therefore not enable more cross-border procurement to be carried out in the area of public contracts. At the same time, however, the local authorities must bear the extremely high costs of the tendering process. On the other hand, I am in support of maintaining the threshold values at their current level, as proposed by the Commission. The aim is to create a genuine single European market in this sector. Furthermore, the increases requested would strip the directive of its impact to the point where it no longer has a raison d' être. I believe that this increase would risk a radical reduction in the number of contracts which would essentially be open to Community competition. The majority of contracts would be granted in accordance with national or regional procedures. This is why I abstained from the vote in plenary. Zappalà report A5-0379/2001
costep_2001-03-15_7_3	Mr President, the results of drug therapy against AIDS partly depend on the question whether those drugs are administered in the correct way, at the correct time, in the correct dosage and under expert supervision. In this, preconditions, such as a sound local infrastructure and stability play a crucial role in the approach to health care. Drugs have an optimum effect if continuity in dispensing and expert supervision in treatment are guaranteed. Otherwise there is a real risk of incorrect or inadequate treatment. The combating of AIDS requires the structural improvement of local health care conditions and support from the World Health Organisation, and the work of the European Union directed to that end is therefore of the greatest importance. Only these factors will guarantee long-term development. In the short term many people are already dying, and for that reason a priority choice for affordable drugs now is advisable, as is rightly argued in the resolution. This resolution refers to a greatly impoverished Africa. The Caribbean region and South East Asia, where the problems are also considerable, must not be forgotten in this discussion.
costep_2007-05-24_10_35	The riots in Tallinn and the attack on the Estonian embassy in Moscow have made Member States aware of the current government’s policy towards individual Member States. However, on this occasion, Moscow, which has adopted a very aggressive stance towards one of the smallest European countries, has bitten off more than it can chew. For the first time, Europe has presented a unified front towards Russia. This is an important day in the history of the European Union, as solidarity is one of the fundamental principles on which the Community is based. That is why I am pleased to have been part of the majority of Members who supported the adoption of the previously mentioned resolution.
costep_1998-09-16_14_7	Mr President, first of all I have a point of order, which I consider to be important. In the list of MEPs who took part in the vote on the Harrison report, neither Mr García Margallo or I are included, despite the fact that we took part in the vote and tabled amendments. Secondly, I would like to congratulate Mr Linkohr and the Commission on this initiative. It is an important proposal for SMEs, which are so vulnerable to delayed payments from their customers, whether they are supplying public authorities or large companies, or subcontracting for them. SMEs, as has been said, are faced with the high financial costs of short term bank loans, high interest on overdrafts and administrative costs due to late payments. They often find themselves with their hands tied, specially in public sector contracts, by large companies who impose disproportionate payment periods on them in their contracts - which they can 'take or leave' - despite the fact that the authorities are generally already obliged to pay the large companies within a certain period. If this occurs on a national level, we can imagine the reluctance and fear that many SMEs must feel about venturing into cross-border operations in the single market. We therefore welcome the fact that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has approved three specific amendments which propose improvements to the Council and the Commission such as banning the main companies in a public contract from asking or demanding that their subcontractors waive their legal rights, and requiring that the obligation of transparency demanded from public authorities should also apply to the relationship between the main contractor and the subcontractor in public procurement contracts. Finally, I think it is important to highlight the amendment which proposes that subcontracting or supplying companies should be given conditions which are at least as favourable as those granted to the main company by the public authority, by guaranteeing that all the fees due are paid within a determined period. In our opinion, more specifically in the opinion of the Spanish socialists, these three proposals from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy deserve the support of the Commission and the Council if we really want to guarantee the survival of these companies in the public contracts sector.
costep_2010-02-10_10_284	It is perfectly understandable that the political, economic and cultural elites of Turkey aspire to EU membership. However, the values, traditions and rules by which we conduct ourselves are public knowledge, and we cannot change them so that simply anyone can join. It is up to the candidate country to accept them, and eventually, after becoming a Member, to try to live by them, but only then. However, during the long process of negotiations that has been ongoing with the EU, the Turkish people have felt that violations of their habits and customs - which, it should be said, are not even being observed - are being imposed, only to be denied membership in the referenda that will surely take place in the Member States, even if the politicians do end up agreeing. Yet Turkey is a friendly nation, with a very rich history and culture. It is our partner in NATO and deserves to be treated as such. In view of this, I would suggest that even at this late stage, there could be a referendum in Turkey where the people are asked whether they acknowledge and want to adopt our principles and values, or whether they would now prefer negotiations to begin for a new and deeper special partnership with the EU.
costep_2003-04-09_3_157	I voted to approve the Accession Treaties only under protest and out of solidarity with my future colleagues. Despite the Commission’s warnings and reproaches during the course of the negotiations, the Council has insisted on committing what is without doubt a breach of the law. The Council’s controversial retention of Annex XV in the Accession Treaty and consequent wholly unilateral alteration of the 2004-2006 financial framework amounts to a breach of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament and the Council. By doing this, it has trodden Parliament’s budgetary rights underfoot. At the same time, it has forced upon Parliament the choice between fighting for its rights and approving the enlargement treaties. Such behaviour by the Council puts an end to our loyal cooperation with it.
costep_2004-04-01_1_71	Given the existence of an internal market with free movement of goods and capital, closer cooperation between the Member States is needed to combat smuggling and tax fraud. This regulation is part of a package of regulations that aims at strengthening mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States, in this case in the field of excise duties, in which tobacco smuggling is particularly significant. The rapporteur regrets, however, that the time is not right to take Community legislation forwards with regard to the harmonisation of indirect taxation, and thus considers cooperation to be a temporary solution. I could not disagree more, because cooperation is an effective method of combating tax fraud and organised crime, not only in relation to excise duties but also to VAT and other indirect taxation. Above all, it is a method that preserves national sovereignty. Harmonisation would result in other economic and tax revenue problems in the Member States. The idea of decentralised cooperation is therefore a good solution.
costep_1997-02-19_12_34	Mr President-in-Office of the Council, first I want to say that I am reassured by your remarks because we still have until 1998 for the final design. I would just like the European Central Bank to be informed, through the Presidency of the Council, of the concern of millions of European citizens who live in the Canary Islands, the Azores, Madeira, the Greek Islands, Ceuta and Melilla, in other words a series of very important territories, because this map does not show their territories, so it could be thought that the currency is not valid in these regions - given that there does seem to be an identification between the map and validity of the currency. The problem may seem trivial to you, but it is of fundamental concern to the inhabitants of these regions and I would like an assurance that the Presidency of the Council will transmit the concern of the Members who represent these regions.
costep_2004-03-08_1_103	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, the Treaty of Amsterdam gives every citizen of the Union a fundamental individual right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, regardless of whether or not he or she exercises an economic activity. This right is also enshrined in the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights. What this means, however, is that the Union’s citizens must be free to move between the various Member States, just as the nationals of one Member State move or change residence within their own territory. We all acknowledge, however, that there are still many barriers to exercising this fundamental right - a situation confirmed by numerous rulings of the Court of Justice on this matter. This is why it is crucial that this directive should be adopted as swiftly as possible, so as to simplify the exercise of the right to move freely. I thus support the recommendation of the rapporteur, Giacomo Santini, whom I wish to congratulate on his excellent work, to adopt this position in its current form. It encompasses many of the amendments tabled by the European Parliament at first reading and is generally well balanced. Furthermore, any new amendment would mean reopening negotiations and would undermine the crucial need for this directive to be adopted, especially given the closeness of enlargement. I should like to emphasise the major proposals, which I believe to be most important. The first of these is to reduce administrative formalities to the bare necessities; secondly, the right to move freely without the need for any formalities for a period of three months; thirdly, to introduce the permanent right of residence after four years of continuous residency in the reception Member State; fourthly, to impose limits on a State’s power to refuse or revoke the right of residence for a Union citizen on the grounds of security or public order; my fifth and last point concerns the definition of the concept of family, I would like to emphasise that harmonising residency requirements for Union citizens must never lead to changes being imposed on Member State legislation and on their own definitions of the family status. The Treaty excludes the right to live as a family from the sphere of Union competence, because this is a matter for national competence.
costep_2000-06-15_8_7	Mr President, the situation in Peru worries us. President Fujimori took power with dangerous plans: to give absolute priority to supposed economic efficiency, claiming that a strong hold on power was required to manage it, and to overcome what he called 'party-ocracy', subliminally blaming all the previous problems on the institutions of the democratic state. Our fears were confirmed throughout Fujimori’s terms in office, and clear signs of authoritarianism were observed, which saw outrageous propaganda and systematic manipulation of the media. Furthermore, the President’s disregard for the rule of law became evident. It was under those circumstances that the elections of April and May were held and, as we feared, they turned out to be a farce, and were recognised and denounced as such by anyone looking on. In summary, that is what our resolution says, and it is good and appropriate that the European Parliament’s voice should be heard in this respect, for our own dignity, and in order to demonstrate our interest in the democratic process in Latin America, but also in order to demonstrate our support, which the Peruvian democrats need and deserve. While we are voting in favour of the resolution in question, I would like to point out two issues relating to its text. Firstly, not just the mere fact that one of the candidates decided not to stand in the second round of the elections, but rather that that candidate was Alejandro Toledo, who is supported by all the opposition, and who in free elections would stand an extremely good chance of toppling Fujimori. My second point is that I regret the fact that the resolution does not refer to the disappointing role played by the Organisation of American States throughout this process. In fact, having denounced the irregularities of the campaign, demanded the postponement of the second round and withdrawn its observers, it does not seem consistent that it should remain silent with no further reaction or sanctions, contenting itself in reality with merely condemning the situation. By taking this attitude, I believe that the OAS has discredited itself considerably. I will end by expressing our solidarity with Alejandro Toledo, with the democrats and people of Peru, denouncing Fujimori as a sinister and autocratic personality, rejecting the position of those people who have reacted with silence and even at times with a certain complacency - which has been well publicised by the President to justify his tattered legitimacy - and reaffirming our commitment to rejecting this farce and to closely monitoring the events in Peru for the sake of the respect for democracy.
costep_2002-05-14_2_82	There is always a connection between my explanations of vote and the reason for my vote for or against a motion, Mr President, although you need to listen very carefully to understand it. With regard to the Foster report, for example, which deals with aviation security, the fact that, as I was flying to Strasbourg, Mr President, I was thinking precisely about aviation security and about this report through which Mrs Foster rightly calls for the implementation of specific measures to ensure that flights are secure, would appear, at first glance, to have no bearing on the matter. I was reflecting that the security envisaged for us by Mrs Foster is so very secure that I hope aircraft do not lose that swaying, rocking motion which enables us to sleep even when we are up among the clouds.
costep_2011-01-19_7_101	The directive on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare is an extremely important document for EU citizens, and so I have followed work on the issue very attentively. I am pleased to note that the directive gives patients the right to choose the place where healthcare will be provided, thereby strengthening the common market, which is the main subject of my work in the European Parliament. This also means that it introduces adaptations which take account of citizens' freedom to travel and work in any EU Member State. This directive, which could be called a Schengen for health, covers such issues as the mutual recognition of prescriptions, an end to discrimination against patients on the grounds of country of origin and the removal of the need for additional insurance abroad. The issue of counterfeit drugs and medicinal products is another very important issue from the point of view of the common market. The directive stresses that they are a serious problem, particularly in the context of cross-border healthcare, and the same is true for medical tourism. The directive tackles this problem by ensuring that the costs of treatment are reimbursed to the level guaranteed in the country of origin, or, if the treatment or procedure cost less than this sum, that the actual costs incurred are reimbursed. The solutions introduced will help to improve the situation of patients in the European Union and will strengthen the common market, and so I voted in favour of adoption of the directive.
costep_2004-12-16_1_14	Mr President, animal protection should be moved immediately from the agricultural heading and from Article 37. It could, of course, be transferred to health and consumer protection because it would then be Commissioner Kyprianou who would be responsible for the matter, which sounds more reassuring. In Denmark, it is the Justice Ministry that is responsible for this matter. We regard animal protection as legal protection, but Article 37 is exclusively about increasing production and earnings. The poor animals must suffer heaven knows what kind of mistreatment when protection itself is subject to greed. It is actually grotesque that export subsidies are paid when horses, cows and sheep have to be sent out of the EU. Animals that are to be slaughtered should only be driven to the nearest abattoir and for a maximum of eight hours. We have a majority in favour of this view in Denmark. Animals that are not to be slaughtered should only be transported for eight hours without rest, food and a change of air, and the accommodation must be in order. That is also something favoured by a majority in Denmark. Of course, the previous Parliament stated this too, and it has to be asked why the Commission did not go to the Council and insist on these conditions being respected. When we obtain the new Constitution, Parliament will have the right of codecision and, if animal protection had no longer been subject to Article 37, Parliament would now already have had this right. Regarding another matter - namely transparency - our Ombudsman expressly stated that the provisions of the new Constitution could properly be used when there was such large support for doing so, so there is a double opportunity for involving Parliament in this procedure right now. What has happened is that a strategy has been chosen whereby a decision has been hurried through, almost as if it were a question of keeping both people and Parliament remote from the decision-making concerned over the next six years. We, indeed I, have noted that the Member States must implement decisions that go further
costep_2005-01-13_1_18	Mr President, yesterday the President of the Commission said that none of us want to have to speak of Europe as being timid and apprehensive. I would ask this House to regard Mr Barroso’s statements yesterday as also relating to Ukraine, as this is another instance in which we should not be timid and apprehensive. We do not all fully appreciate what happened in Ukraine. I am aware that Ukraine is a long way away, and that it is a country with which we are unfamiliar. We know a great deal about Cuba or Iraq, and almost nothing about Ukraine. Yet Ukraine is a powerful country in Eastern Europe, and recent events in this country can easily be compared to another fall of the Berlin Wall, albeit the Berlin Wall in the East. Up until the Orange Revolution, democratic principles were unheard of to the east of the European Union, with the exception of the tiny country of Georgia. They remain unheard of today in Russia and Belarus, as well as in the other former Soviet republics. Apart from the tiny country of Georgia, which dared to make a stand for democracy a year ago, the only other place where such principles are currently adhered to is a powerful country of 50 million inhabitants. This country covers an area greater than that of France, and its people vigorously and resolutely called for democratic principles to be applied in practice and not just on paper. This is a major revolution, and our actions should be equal to these events. Up until now, the European Union’s actions have indeed been equal to events in Ukraine. I will be honest and admit that I was amazed to see the European Union react so rapidly, and to see that it was mediators from the European Union, and not from the United States, who played a leading role in the resolution of conflict in Ukraine. I was proud of that, but I certainly did not feel proud as I listened to Mr Potočnik’s statements today. It would appear that the Commissioner, the European Commission and the European Council are regretting their involvement after 21 November, and now wish to withdraw. We cannot give our consent to this. We became involved, we acted as mediators, and we ensured matters were resolved peacefully. Our duty is to continue providing assistance to the Orange Revolution and to democracy in Ukraine, and to open the European Union’s doors to a country that lies entirely within Europe’s geographical boundaries. Applause
costep_2004-02-12_1_13	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank our rapporteur for the very complete nature of his report. It contains absolutely everything we may wish to find, and so it is a pleasure to read and support it. I would like to take this opportunity to stress that we have made women the emblem of the oppression of the Afghan people. We have made women the emblem of the fight against the Taliban. Will we make women the emblem of the reconstruction of Afghanistan? That is not certain and therefore - as was said on comparing the situation in Afghanistan with that in Iraq just now - at times of war or liberation, in certain countries, the issue of women arises and becomes particularly acute. In this regard, the situation of Iraqi women is alarming. So why do we not focus on the issue of women today in Afghanistan? Commissioner, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities has had an exchange of letters with you in relation to the attention paid to the issue of women within the framework of reconstruction and in relation to the proportion of aid earmarked by the European Union for this issue. We wanted 20%. I realise that this is enormous and that the figure is perhaps rather arbitrary. In fact, it appears that 2% is allocated to this chapter. Mainstreaming, above all in the field of health, certainly plays its role to the full, and so we are not going to talk about figures. Having said that, what really amazes me, as well as the scant importance attached to the issue of women, is above all the absence of an education dossier in the Commission’s work and in the budget lines proposed. Everybody knows that the issue of education, and in particular the education of girls, is essential within the context of women as an emblem of reconstruction. That was the first comment I wanted to make. The second is that we are certainly very happy with the mention of the principle of equality between men and women in the Constitution. We ourselves are fighting, in this House, for this principle to be present in the European Constitution. It follows that this issue does not only arise over in Afghanistan, but here as well. We are very well aware, here, that a principle is not sufficient, that it needs to be applied. We are happy with what has just happened in Morocco in relation to women’s rights, but we are waiting for it to be applied. The same is clearly true for Afghanistan as it is for us.
costep_1998-12-16_14_9	Mr President, thanks in part to the Montreal Protocol, we shall be able to quickly phase out substances which deplete the ozone layer. The desired effect, closing the hole in the ozone layer, will not be felt for a hundred years. We also hope that by then the number of skin cancer cases will have fallen. It is a good thing that the European Union wants to take measures to hasten this phasing-out process. And it can be done, given the rapidly growing number of alternatives available. The manufacture, use and marketing of methyl bromide is to cease by the year 2001. And there can be no exemptions on grounds of climatological conditions. Climatological conditions in Dutch and German greenhouses are the same as in the southern Member States, but methyl bromide has not been used in the Netherlands since 1992 and is now banned in Germany as well. If the right technology is used, there is no loss in productivity and it is healthier for the workers too. As regards the use of HCFCs in fire extinguishers as an alternative to halon, I can say that this is already banned, and therefore in Italy as well, despite the fact that Italy is ignoring a judgment by the European Court. Alternatives to HCFCs are now available too, and these, moreover, are not carcinogenic. The only exemption which we regard as justified is for 'critical uses', for example CFCs in inhalers or chemical precursors for pharmaceuticals. Since these substances cannot be obtained outside the EU in sufficiently pure form, all trade in ozone-depleting substances with countries outside the EU must be prohibited.
costep_2006-11-14_12_52	There are 25 national legislations governing mortgage credit, and soon there will be 27 standing in the way of a common European approach. This Green Paper issued by the European Commission will finally make it possible to carry out proper studies of this issue and to go for the sensible options. Any Community measure concerning the European mortgage credit market must, above all, be of direct benefit to the public. However, consumers often come up against too many obstacles, be they legal or economic. In voting in favour of the report by Mr Purvis, I opted for making the mortgage credit market accessible to a larger number of potential borrowers. In the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I had, in this connection, personally pushed for its rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, to take account of borrowers with insecure and insubstantial credit profiles, workers on fixed-term contracts and first-time buyers.
costep_1998-11-04_5_12	Mr President, let me do Mrs Green and our President too something of a favour. Coming up shortly is the Commission programme which Mr Santer will present to us. I have to tell you that we have no documents about it at all. Would it not be a good idea to continue the debate on enlargement and say to Mr Santer: just give us the paper or the letters we need. You have to give us the texts. So I am grateful to Mrs Green - give us the texts and we will postpone the debate. I think that is a far better idea.
costep_1997-10-24_3_11	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe responsible businesses have been providing for the delivery of animals in the best condition. Many transport firms have allowed inspection in order to counter repeated criticisms of animal transport. We should take note of this fact also in today’s general debate. Unfortunately, there is always a reverse side to the medal. This is what the report by Mrs Anttila emphasizes: that there are those who do not pay sufficient attention to providing transport suitable for animals. It is now up to us to take the initiative and confront them with all the rigour of the law. In order to improve the transport of live animals we must demand compliance with the following points: Firstly, the frequency of controls should be increased, both within the EU and in third countries. Transport problems usually occur not because of faults in the legislation, but in its execution. Secondly, specific transport conditions which meet EU legislation must be produced and, most particularly, agreed. That includes the recipient third countries. Thirdly, we need strict and rigorously applied sanctions against gross negligence or premeditated transgression of animal welfare regulations. And last but not least, Madam Commissioner, we require the European Commission so to set the export repayments for beef and cattle for slaughter, that there is no longer any economic incentive to export live animals to third countries. In the international transport industry in particular, effective animal welfare is only possible with unified European legislation. I do not deny that this is a very difficult and laborious process at European level, otherwise we should not have been talking about his subject for such a long time. I am also aware, of course, that granting export subsidies is frequently open to general criticism. Natural production conditions, environmental limitations, animal welfare criteria and animal health regulations in the EU mean, however, that our domestic beef product is less good value than that from the Argentine or the USA. In commerce it is usual in such cases for rising costs simply to force businesses to move abroad. Our farmers cannot do that, so that WTO agreements on the beef industry now provide for a drastic reduction in beef exports and subsidies on exports. Between 1995 and 2001 they are due to be reduced from 1.1 million to 0.8 million tonnes. Whilst that is one way, I think that European agriculture, what with BSE and growing surpluses, is going to be under constant pressure. I think we should prohibit animal transport generally. For the consumer that sounds good, but on the other hand consumers are not prepared to pay more for the product, just so that we can afford this luxury.
costep_2001-03-13_5_14	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is absolutely no question that we are all in favour of sensible management and control of immigration, including by means of protecting the external borders of the Union. I believe that we are all in agreement as regards this and that there is no need to argue about it. However, I think we also agree, on the other hand, - and Mr Kirkhope especially, as a former British Home Affairs Minister, will agree with me here - that we will ultimately not achieve very much with all these individual measures and that we are dealing with an area in which we are not seeking to solve the basic problems but, by taking small steps, at least to achieve something. If this is the case, then it is also clear that our discussion must be as free from ideology as possible. If we also agree, then, that we want an ideology-free discussion and we know that illegal immigration can never, in fact, be completely prevented - in other words, there will always be illegal immigration, no matter what happens - then, of course, we have to admit that we can ultimately achieve very little with penalties for carriers alone. If we are in agreement about this too, then we must also acknowledge, Mr Kirkhope, that if we want to do something, then we have to engage in discussions with the carriers themselves. I am currently engaged in discussions with representatives of the international transport trade unions and I think there is still room for finding common ways forward on this. But when one speaks with these companies, Mr Kirkhope, one realises that your proposals are not at all helpful and that they attempt to frame the French initiative, which itself was already rejected by the carriers, even more restrictively. At this point, I ask myself why we are dealing at all with a report that no one supports.
costep_1997-06-12_5_42	I am afraid that a special envoy would be laughed down just as much as the European tigers. In any event, two months ago the NLD attempted to celebrate its overwhelming victory in the elections seven years before, and the military junta reacted with its usual restraint by immediately putting 300 activists behind bars. ASEAN’s decision to allow Burma membership is a slap in the face for the international community and for the so-called universality of human rights. Just when President Clinton announces sanctions against Burma, ASEAN does the complete opposite. And I have to agree with Mrs van Bladel that the new investors are mostly not European firms but Asian tigers. The Union is already taking action, and I must admit that it is quite good as far as it goes. But we need to persuade ASEAN to change its policy towards Burma. How we can most effectively bring pressure to bear on the SLORC regime remains to be seen, but I hope that what we say here, whether we are laughed at or not, sometimes gets through at least to Aung San Suu Kyi, so that she knows that we are still determined to show solidarity with her.
costep_1998-03-10_10_20	Like the speaker, Sir Leon, I am pleased with the statement published last week on commercial communication. In view of the fact that the many recent complaints, particularly on the loi Evin, have not been dealt with seriously, my question is whether it was President Santer’s office or the President himself who considered it necessary to wait until the statement came out. Also, will the expert group which is soon to be set up investigate the complaints thoroughly? Could you give this Parliament and me some more information about the various positions within the Commission on the treatment of the complaints we have before us?
costep_2006-12-11_14_43	Mr President, chemical substances are part of our environment and can be found all around us. Rapid industrial development in the 20th century has meant, however, that our daily use of these substances has become not only a necessity but also a pleasure. Many of these substances do not genuinely improve our quality of life, though, as they are hazardous and harmful to our health. It is difficult to imagine life without chemical substances. That is precisely why we must insist on greater transparency and information about the substances contained in products used by human beings. The REACH system should be based on the principle of prevention and precaution. The need for the consumer to be assured that a particular product is not harmful must be central to the new legislation, and the responsibility for providing that assurance must rest with industry. Any producer wishing to place a new product on the market or retain an existing concession must be able to prove that the products for which he or she is responsible are safe for human beings and the environment. The compromise reached goes a long way towards responding to these expectations and therefore deserves our support. Nonetheless, like all compromises, it gives some cause for concern. In particular, I have reservations about the provisions concerning sharing information, as this will significantly weaken the position of around twenty-five thousand small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union. The attempts to extend the patent period, initially to 15 years and eventually to 12, are detrimental to innovation as they strengthen the economic dominance of rich companies. The longer the periods, the less the pressure on companies to seek new solutions and undertake new research. In conclusion, despite its many positive features relating mainly to health issues, the REACH regulation does not treat economic entities on an equal footing. Nonetheless, this compromise does deserve our support.
costep_2010-01-20_5_39	Once again, the Spanish Presidency of the EU has come at a crucial time. Eight years ago, in the first half of 2002, Spain had to face up to the challenge of introducing the euro as a common currency. Now, the Spanish Presidency stands before an equally momentous task - implementation of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. The division of competences between the Member State Presidency and the President of the European Council will be of great significance. Giving priority to foreign policy which strengthens the Union’s position in the world arena is worthy of support. However, will the newly appointed High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy do this? These fears result from Mrs Ashton’s statements and her past, but also from her first actions since taking office. I do not suppose we need to convince anyone that the fight against the crisis and its negative economic and social consequences is still necessary. Such action is especially in the interest of Spain, which has been hit by the recession exceptionally hard. How can we return to maintaining the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact by both large and small Member States? How should the fight against the crisis in Europe and the world be coordinated? An additional challenge resulting from the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon is the necessity to arrange cooperation within the Trio Presidency. Spain is going to have to coordinate its work with Belgium and Hungary. It is especially important to ensure a smooth transition between individual presidencies so that continuity of work is maintained. I wish the Spanish Presidency success.
costep_2007-10-24_12_17	The report refers to recent changes in Serbia. Much still remains to be done, however, notably in the area of cooperation between the Government and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Despite promises made, Radko Mladić has not been arrested and handed over to the Tribunal in The Hague. The lack of progress in this area of cooperation is cause for concern and impacts negatively on perception of the action taken by the Serb authorities to strengthen the rule of law. The new constitution and the provisions relating to the protection of human rights and the rights of national minorities, the security services, the judiciary and the army, and also the efforts to eliminate corruption, do represent movement in the right direction. There are certain shortcomings to the reforms, however, such as the failure to appoint a Constitutional Court which would act as the guardian of democracy. It is essential for the measures adopted and the commitments entered into by Serbia to be monitored. Despite the progress made, much still remains to be accomplished in Serbia.
costep_1999-04-12_4_26	Mr President, when the Treaty of Amsterdam becomes effective next month the Union will have a lot more scope than at present to act to ensure the single market can work effectively. This is a good thing, but the problem is that the Member States have not up till now had a clear enough vision of how cooperation under the third pillar might be more effectively developed. For example, there is an inexcusably wide difference in standards among the Member States when it comes to surveillance of the Union’s external borders. The problems that are rife in the single market, such as drug trafficking, the growing availability of illegal drugs and trafficking in human beings, and the contributory cause of all such problems, which is the less than perfect way surveillance is carried out on the Union’s external borders, all call for Europol to play an even greater role in the future than is provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam. Europol cannot be allowed to remain just a bureaucratic central agency. If cooperation between the police and the customs authorities cannot be made closer, the future is hardly rosy for the single market, especially as the Union’s future enlargement to the east will in any case mean extra pressures and totally new challenges with regard to the surveillance of the Union’s external borders and our efforts to combat organised crime.
costep_2003-09-04_4_138	Among the numerous annual reports adopted by the Parliament, there are many that are of genuine interest. This is not, however, the case with this infamous report on fundamental rights in the Union, which, far from serving the European cause, emphasises the worst in community federalism. The reasoning behind such a report is in itself rather strange since, for the Parliament, it consists in denouncing alleged attacks on fundamental rights, attacks supposedly committed by the Member States of the European Union. In fact, it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that anyone consulting this indigestible document would inevitably have the impression that the European Union, made up of what are as good as banana republics, has become an area of lawlessness. Overcrowding in prisons, attacks on the freedom of conscience, discrimination against minorities, (economic) control of the media, an increase in the number of racist acts, restrictive migratory policies, etc.: no Member State is spared and, in fact, it is the whole of the European Union that appears to be an area where freedoms are killed off. Clearly, all this is but fantasy. It remains, nonetheless, that, controlled by powerful lobbies agitating for human rights; the Parliament would make a fool of itself by adopting this report.
costep_2009-04-21_17_29	Madam President, for the success of an undertaking like the creation of a uniform energy space, common and coordinated investments in the energy infrastructure are essential. A key task is to increase the generating capacity of European power stations and develop the cross-border network. At the same time the good of the environment and the guidelines of the climate and energy package should be kept in mind. Another challenge which appears when harmonising the EU energy market is the matter of ensuring security of supplies of energy sources from outside the EU. For economic reasons as well as for reasons of security it is necessary to strive for diversification of supplies and increase efforts to develop the European energy system. Finally, there is a fear that opening the energy market fully to competition may be a danger to the poorest people of the EU, who often are not able to pay their bills regularly. It is worth considering at this point possible instruments which would guarantee that such people will not have their electricity cut off.
costep_1999-09-15_9_16	Mr President, the United Left has already voiced our objections to the neo-liberal intentions of Mr Prodi’s proposed team. These objections relate in particular to the Dutch candidate Mr Bolkestein, for he is the most outspoken proponent of policies for effecting cutbacks, privatisation, deregulation and the lowering of taxation. A few months back, during the election campaign for this Parliament, the people heading the list of candidates of almost all the Dutch parties were quite vocal in saying that Mr Bolkestein should not be permitted to become a Member of the Commission. His attitudes were often provocative, which led to him being labelled a euro-sceptic. I do not actually think that he has ever been one. It is true that he is keen for the Netherlands to be a tax haven for large companies and high incomes and he does not want the European Union to hinder him in this. That is why he certainly would not be the right person to take on the taxation harmonisation portfolio. But now, the vast majority of Dutch MEPs have voted for a Commission of which Mr Bolkestein is a Member, thereby completely breaking their promise to the Dutch electorate. My party, the Socialist party in the Netherlands, does not go along with this.
costep_2010-10-07_13_122	Ladies and gentlemen, I am very concerned about events in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where hundreds if not thousands of women and children have been raped in the last few months. As a politician, I am stunned, even more so as a father and a man. It is terrible. Those guilty must be found, prosecuted and punished in accordance with international law. We, the international community, have failed. However, we also failed much closer to home, in our own territory. We always rush to condemn human rights violations outside the European Union and demand that urgent action be taken. However, when attention turns to human rights violations within the EU, the reaction is mostly restrained. The EU will be hit by a huge crisis of confidence if it fails to narrow the gap between its honourable condemnations of crimes committed outside the EU and actions being taken at home in the area of human rights. It should not be this way. The Treaty of Lisbon brought new opportunities to strengthen human rights, especially the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is now mandatory, not just for EU institutions, but also for Member States. Thus, it is within our capabilities to fix this human rights vacuum within the EU, but we must act now.
costep_2009-05-07_6_10	Mr President, the Universal Declaration of UNESCO on Cultural Diversity recommends that, among other things, we promote the making of high-quality audiovisual productions, particularly fostering the creation of cooperation mechanisms allowing us to distribute those productions; the European Commission has clearly borne this statement in mind when drawing up this initiative. It goes without saying that MEDIA Mundus will take advantage of the growing interest and opportunities created by worldwide cooperation in the audiovisual industry and will widen the range of possibilities for consumers, bringing products that are more culturally diverse to European and international markets and creating new commercial opportunities for audiovisual professionals in Europe and around the world. It is my conviction, and we should be in no doubt, that the Commission is capable of managing the budget so that this has the greatest impact possible and does not fade away into separate projects. As a prestigious professor said, the MEDIA Mundus programme for audiovisual cooperation with third countries is proof that the international audiovisual landscape has changed considerably, particularly in technological terms. This initiative aims to develop opportunities for cooperation in the audiovisual market, boosting research and training as well as financing coproduction projects in order to boost cooperation between audiovisual professionals. I also wish to finish by expressing my gratitude. It has been a pleasure working with all my colleagues in the Committee on Culture and Education for these past two years. Thank you, see you soon.
costep_2003-05-14_3_244	Mr President, we feel the Commission Communication is highly relevant and Mr van den Berg’s report adds certain contributions that enrich the original text. He has shown flexibility by accepting the majority of the amendments tabled, and, on behalf of my parliamentary group, I would like to say that we shall vote for the report. In fact, many fora and macroconferences have already been held in relation to the need to increase efforts to eradicate poverty, which is undoubtedly the most serious problem we face. It is something of a coincidence that, with the resources now available, it will not be possible to achieve the objectives set for 2015. It is good, however, that, within our limited means, we are focusing our attention on health and education, which are so closely linked and interdependent. It has been clearly shown that health and education, education and health, are the best policies for development, that they enable millions of human beings to escape poverty. It is true that some progress is being made, as stated by the rapporteur. In Africa, for example, 60% of children today attend school, which means that 40% are still not attending. In other words, 45 million children are condemned to illiteracy and poverty, probably for life. New difficulties have arisen in some countries. The tragedy of child soldiers means that, in some West African countries, mothers prevent their sons from attending school for fear that they will be kidnapped and not return home, as we have seen recently, last week, in Ivory Coast, in a report by various agencies and other NGOs present on the ground. The problems of gender segregation are still causing an unsustainable situation in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries. In Latin America investment in education has dropped alarmingly over the past few years of crisis throughout the region, and this affects ethnic minorities in particular, as the Commissioner has pointed out today, in Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, but also in countries such as Argentina, which until now had an excellent education system but is now moving backwards. By attending school, both boys and girls can and should receive a basic education that contributes to improving health, not just in relation to HIV and the ways in which it is transmitted - as the rapporteur reminds us - which, although it is a serious problem, is no more serious than other problems that could be alleviated more cheaply. This is the case of food hygiene, to cite just one example. I feel it is particularly necessary for international financial organisations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to review their criteria and make them more flexible in order to promote free, universal education. That is now one of the priorities we must address and try to achieve some progress in this specific area.
costep_1997-02-18_7_58	Mr President, given that Parliament, through Maastricht, has acquired the right to use a collective vote of censure as a parliamentary weapon, every Member of this supreme representative body within Europe should handle it responsibly. In the vote on the Medina report, 16 members of the Committee of Inquiry voted against the limpest of motions from the Socialist Group, so that the report which is now before the House was adopted without the planned recommendation for a qualified vote of censure. The press was full of this, as we know. Now we are retrieving the situation with some appropriate resolutions, which we shall be voting on tomorrow. This opposition - on my part too, I would point out - was not ducking the issue and did not reflect a lack of courage, quite the opposite. The motion in question amounted to an even more toned-down vote of censure, no time for it being set and the date of December 1997 being deleted. Those who threaten to use a vote of censure - of whatever kind - from the very beginning of an inquiry, and then in the end produce only the limpest forms of words, are damaging not only themselves, but Parliament as a whole, since everyone can see the reason for the lack of enthusiasm which has been mentioned: most of the Commissioners who would have to go would be from the ranks of the social democratic group! Furthermore, the main point at issue here is surely not to demonstrate the guilt or innocence of the Commission which is now in office. For us as elected representatives, the point must rather be our duty to restore to European consumers the confidence which they demand and deserve. In other words, we MEPs would be well advised to join with the Commission in forming a counterbalance to the Council, rather than acting against it, above all in the light of the negotiations currently taking place at the Intergovernmental Conference. That does not prevent us from expressing our views to one another plainly and frankly, and that is the point at issue today here in the House. What is to be done? On the basis of the recommendations in the Medina report and Parliament’s resolution, the Commission should now rectify its omissions as quickly as possible and correct the flaws which have been highlighted by the Committee of Inquiry. The statements by President Santer indicate that the Commission is ready to do so. However, should this not be carried through within a reasonable period of time, contrary to expectations, in other words by the end of this year, then we should not just raise a warning finger, as was the case with the vote in the Committee of Inquiry, but would really be obliged to hold a vote of censure pursuant to Article 144 of the Treaty.
costep_2009-11-23_17_29	I am delighted to see this lengthy, highly controversial work reach its conclusion; it shows the importance of the telecommunications sector not only as an economic player but also as a vital element in today’s society. Our citizens communicate across borders on a daily basis and our aim was to guarantee quality of services while ensuring that users' fundamental rights were respected. I want to congratulate Mrs Trautmann and the negotiating team for the compromise they have achieved, making any sanctions taken against users subject to a prior contradictory procedure. Furthermore, the Commission was committed to guaranteeing net neutrality and to combating anti-competitive, discriminatory practices carried out by operators. This agreement will mean consumers benefit from many positive developments which were sometimes the result of tough negotiations. I particularly wish to highlight guaranteed access and localisation for calls made to the emergency number (112); improved access for the disabled; greater information on contracts and billing; warnings in cases of unusually high usage; the introduction of a maximum delay when transferring a customer’s telephone number; and information in cases of security breaches relating to personal data.
costep_2011-06-23_14_462	The coordination of the Member States' economic policies, in line with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, involves observance of the following guiding principles: stable prices, robust public finances and monetary conditions, and a sustainable balance of payments. The aim is to lay down rules regulating the content, presentation, examination and monitoring of stability programmes and convergence programmes, as part of the multilateral surveillance to be carried out by the Commission and the Council at an early stage. The intention is to prevent budget deficits and excessive debt occurring, and to promote the surveillance and coordination of economic policy, so supporting the achievement of the Union’s objectives regarding growth and jobs. The European Parliament shall be duly involved in the European Semester in order to increase transparency, ownership and accountability for the decisions taken, specifically through economic dialogue. For the above reasons, I voted for this report.
costep_2008-06-05_9_14	I voted in favour of the joint report by my Finnish colleagues Kyösti Virrankoski and Ville Itälä on the third draft amending budget of the European Union for 2008. It relates mainly to: the budgeting of the revenue accruing from the Microsoft case (fine and interest totalling EUR 849 200 000); the budgeting of savings arising from the smaller than estimated increase for salaries and pensions of officials in 2007; the reinforcement of the emergency fund for veterinary measures due to the bluetongue crisis (EUR 130 million in commitment appropriations, and EUR 63 950 000 in payment appropriations); the creation of budgetary items to accommodate subsidies for four Joint Undertakings: Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), Clean Sky, ARTEMIS (embedded computing systems) and ENIAC (European Technology Platform on Nanoelectronics), totalling EUR 257.5 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 194.6 million in payment appropriations from the Seventh Framework Programme for Research; and the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for an amount of EUR 98 million (forest fires in Greece and floods in Slovenia).
costep_2010-01-20_5_30	I am glad to hear about the 'Innovating Europe' programme introduced by the Spanish Presidency, because it has set the acceleration of developing a policy on tourism as a priority, including giving consideration to the viewpoints of tourists regarding the EU policies related to the industry. To this end, the Presidency is focusing on creating a European model of tourism, taking into account group tourism as well. I call your attention to the fact that the interests of persons with disabilities should also be given maximum consideration. Furthermore, in the field of transport, the Presidency proposes to support intelligent transport systems, which I fully agree with, and I take the opportunity here to repeat: the European Union should discontinue the legal practice of adopting and keeping in force as many regulations as there are means of transport. At present, people with different transport needs are not provided with the same level of transport services, in spite of all having the same passengers' rights. I suggest the Presidency take into consideration the statement made by Siim Kallas, Commissioner-designate, in which he referred to free movement as one of the most fundamental freedoms of European citizens, manifested in modern transport. The Commissioner-designate agreed with the initiative, and promised to create a uniform Code of Conduct pertaining to all sectors of transport. By doing so, he can ensure during his mandate that all European citizens have clear and transparent rights, and the Spanish Presidency could and should play an important role in this.
costep_2010-05-05_19_50	The strategy for the future of Europe is built on the basis of two value systems, and I would like to draw attention to the fact that these two value systems can only be reconciled with great difficulty, if at all, so we ought to choose between them. The key words for one of the value systems are competitiveness, growth, globalisation, while for the other, the key word is sustainability. We are talking about sustainability in the environmental sense. We know that forced growth and globalisation have dreadful consequences for the environment. There is no question of sustainability. We are talking about sustainability in the social sense. Those people, smallholders, small and medium-sized enterprises, among others, who cannot keep up with the overheated competition and globalisation go under, fall out of competition and become impoverished. This is completely contrary to sustainability in the social sense. My electorate and myself are of the opinion that between the two value systems we have to choose sustainability.
costep_2010-10-21_8_102	The European Union must continue an active dialogue with Ukraine concerning its accession to our Union, although we appreciate that it will not become a Member State in the next few years. It is in all our interests to see Ukraine as an economically developed and politically stable state, with its closest partners to be found in the West. We understand that it will not be easy to achieve this, for that country must stabilise its financial situation and carry out numerous reforms. However, this must be done and the EU should offer its support to this work. The constructive work on the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement must continue and work on the extended Free Trade Agreement must be given a kick start. Geographically, Ukraine is situated in a very important location, which is also important for gas supply to the EU. That is why it is necessary to support the modernisation of Ukraine’s gas transit system, in order to reduce the risk of interruption to gas supplies to EU countries, as has happened recently. At the same time, we must not turn a blind eye to violations of democracy, which have become more serious since Viktor Yanukovych took office as President. It is our duty to point out these violations and take a strong stand on compliance with Western values in Ukraine, for our Union is founded on those values.
costep_2002-03-12_2_250	Mr President, first of all, congratulations to Mrs Isler Béguin on her report which I think is excellent and constructive. The protection of biodiversity deserves top priority. When species become extinct, they are gone for ever, and this is why now is the time for action. Action plans cannot be non-committal. They can only be successful if they take account of the socio-economic circumstances of the people in that area. They must set priorities. We must tackle hot spots worldwide; areas that are particularly rich in species deserve special protection. Action plans must be clear and, above all, concrete. Public support is important, and nobody gets excited about an abstract idea such as biodiversity. It is about the conservation of the natural resources, valuable landscapes and endangered species. We must be well-informed, independent monitoring must be put in place, and we must draw up annual balance sheets of the quality of the natural environment. This motivates and inspires. The European Union itself should be a little more consistent. The bird directive and the habitat directive epitomise biodiversity protection. These must be implemented effectively, however difficult that may be at times. The end result must always be at the forefront of our minds. However, these pearls of nature preservation are in sharp contrast with other policy. I mean in the first place agriculture, but also fisheries. Large-scale agriculture and the conservation of biodiversity are a difficult match. The common agricultural policy must for that reason alone undergo far-reaching changes. Subsidies purely based on production are asking for trouble. The fishery implications for biodiversity are less visible. Seabed disturbance in many coastal waters and deeper waters threatens biodiversity. This should be met with a forceful response. Biodiversity must form a guideline in regional planning. Member States should draft action plans for that purpose. I ask the Commission to select and support a flagship project annually, preferably in one of the candidate countries. These projects must set an example to other nature reserves. The Polish primeval forest could be a good flagship project. I should once again like to thank Mrs Isler Béguin for her sound report.
costep_2009-12-15_14_20	Mr President, regarding specific restrictive measures, freezing funds belonging to individuals and entities linked to al-Qaeda and measures against members of the Zimbabwean and Somalian Governments, on 5 November, the Commission and the Council said that once the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, the proposals would be based on Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union rather than Article 75. Article 215 states that the Council shall inform Parliament of any decisions that provide for the interruption or reduction of economic relations, etc. Article 75, however, makes it clear that when it is necessary in order to achieve the objectives set out in Article 67, Parliament and the Council shall define, in other words, shall jointly decide on regulatory measures for the freezing of funds, financial assets or economic gains belonging to, owned or held by natural or legal persons, groups or entities associated with terrorist activities. Article 67 also sets out the objectives of the foundations of the area of freedom, security and justice. It therefore appears to be clear that, with regard to people or entities associated with terrorist activities, the legal basis for the Council’s proposals for regulations should be Article 75. With regard to Zimbabwe and Somalia, the Council and the Commission could also consider the Solemn Declaration of Stuttgart, which provides for optional consultation of Parliament on international affairs, including when the treaties do not establish anything in that respect. I am simply clarifying my position, Mr President. I want to claim Parliament’s role as colegislator, here and now, and ask the Council and the Commission for a more reasonable explanation. That is all for now.
costep_2010-10-20_11_28	I believe that Ukraine is one of the closest potential partners of the European Union. The Ukrainians are much closer to Europe civilisation-wise than are the Turks or the Albanians. The Ukrainian people have freely elected a change because the democratic orange powers have run the country into poverty, hopelessness and decay. Yanukovych was long in opposition and his attitude to the current opposition reflects the treatment he received from the orange leaders. Moreover, we must also recognise the fact that he probably remembers the earlier period when he was victimised by the orange league, and the European Union reacted by simply smiling benevolently. Unless we want to lose Ukraine as our future member, let us be patient and concentrate on economic cooperation; let us build up a climate of mutual trust. We must explain to the government that the opposition has its legitimate place in a democratic society, and to the opposition that unless it gains sufficient support from the people, it has no right to compete for power.
costep_2005-10-27_1_113	Mr President, the resolutions we adopted on 18 November 2004 and 13 January 2005, combined with massive diplomatic protests and the actions of human rights organisations did have some results, for they did bring about the commutation of the death sentence passed on the respected Lama Tenzin Delek Rinpoche to one of life imprisonment. The Chinese authorities regard him as a criminal, accusing him of undermining the security of the state, and - without any evidence - of involvement in bomb attacks. They continue to refuse him a fair trial with international observers present. Where I am in full agreement with both the previous speakers is that the real reason for his imprisonment is his great influence on the Tibetan people and his support for the Dalai Lama. The death sentence may well have been annulled, but it appears to be being carried out by other means; having endured torture and solitary confinement, he is now unable either to speak or to move, and his life is hanging in the balance. All this House’s political groupings call on the Chinese to delay no longer in improving the conditions under which he is held and to comply strictly with the terms of the UN Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners. We insist that Manfred Nowak, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, be given free access to Tenzin Rinpoche; he will be arriving in China on an inspection mission in three weeks’ time. The European Commission, the Council and the Member States must establish a close connection between the ongoing fate of China’s political prisoners and the maintenance of the arms embargo imposed on that country. The embargo must remain in place, without any relaxation, for as long as human rights abuses continue. The Chinese Embassy in Brussels has attempted to intervene, claiming that these are internal matters, and that no external organisations or individuals have the right to interfere. These oppressive utterances constitute yet another example of the unsatisfactory outcome of the EU/China Summit of 5 September and of the failure of the human rights dialogue to yield tangible fruit. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wishes to stress the need for international standards and values to be maintained. What does send a powerful signal to all those who are persecuted for political, religious or cultural reasons is the European Union’s insistence on cooperation with any country being conditional - without any exception - on its respect for human rights. Those who want confrontation to give way to cooperation must uphold human rights and refrain from violating them, for human rights are universal in their application.
costep_2010-05-18_13_32	I would stress that it is with great satisfaction - shall we say - that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and its Portuguese Members are seeing the start of Europe’s process of accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. In the end, in a country like Portugal - which has always been at the forefront of human rights with the abolition of slavery in Portugal as soon as 1761 and which was a pioneer in abolishing the death penalty - we could clearly only be interested in supporting this accession process. I would like, however, to call attention to the fact that we believe it to be very important for Parliament to monitor the EU’s process of accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. We consider this to be essential from a technical, legal and political point of view, because Parliament itself is a House of human rights and one in which human rights are of great importance. I would also like it to be noted, Members, that we consider it very important that we are in contact with many third states; this is a very important signal that we are giving to the members of the Council of Europe (the entry of the European Union to the Council of Europe) who are not Member States. For these members of the Council of Europe, it is a signal of strengthening, of a commitment by the European Union to the situation and levels of democracy and respect for fundamental rights.
costep_2009-03-25_4_74	I have voted against the motion for a resolution on an Interim Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, on the one part, and the SADC EPA States, on the other part. I do not think that the Economic Partnership Agreement has brought great advantages for those who export from ACP countries to the European Union since the Cotonou trade agreements expired at the beginning of 2008, even if goods from ACP countries can enter the EU market without being subject to customs tariffs or quotas. In particular, the agreement does not help to promote the autonomous development of these states; to create those capacities that in the future will enable the countries concerned to continue to develop even without outside help. What is more, I feel that they often do not meet the conditions of good governance, transparency of political positions and respect for human rights, without which there is a risk that damage to the population of those states would outweigh the aid they receive.
costep_2011-02-02_18_23	The conclusion of these agreements has made it possible to bring an end to one of the most complex and longest=running disputes against the EU in the World Trade Organisation. It should be mentioned that, throughout the negotiation process, we warned the Commission of the need to take care of: - the interests and specificities of banana producers in the outermost regions, notably by increasing funding under the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI), as producers' incomes and the marketing of their produce could be compromised by the pressures created by strengthening the increasing liberalisation of the global banana trade; - the interests and specificities of banana producers in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. I therefore consider the conclusions of the rapporteur’s recommendation - according to which the outermost regions' interests should also be considered - to be a contribution of great relevance, in that Parliament should consent to the agreements if the Commission and Council: present to Parliament, as soon as possible, an impact assessment on the consequences of the agreements for banana-producing developing countries and for the outermost regions; implement specific measures aimed at strengthening banana producers' commercial position, and adopt measures to finance a programme in favour of banana-producing ACP countries.
costep_2005-12-12_1_125	Lately, we have increasingly been paying attention to tax policy, despite it being more of a national policy issue. Unfortunately, such discussions are limited to the examination of individual taxes and not the assessment of the aggregate impact of each tax type upon the economy. The purpose of the profits tax is to promote supply, or, as it is often put, entrepreneurship. These characteristics vary from country to country and depend on a number of factors, such as traditions, education and historical experience. Thus, it is obvious that different degrees of effort are needed to promote entrepreneurship in different countries, and, therefore, different rates of tax on profits must be applied. My group will not approve the amendments proposing, in one way or another, to achieve the equalisation of rates of tax on profits. Nevertheless, we support the proposals in the report of Mr Bersani to develop a common tax base calculation and enforcement procedure. We believe that the introduction of the common tax base will, first of all, allow greater exploitation of the single market advantages, and, secondly, will enable the talents of businessmen to be manifested not only in their countries, but also in the entire European Union. This will also contribute to the development of an entrepreneurial tradition and make it easier to meet the challenges of globalisation. What causes the concern then? There are two issues that are of concern and should probably be further considered in our legislative activities. First, ways to prevent unfair competition, where small enterprises use the wider tax base of their home countries, while larger enterprises operating in several countries will be able to opt for the most favourable tax base among those countries. Second, how to distribute tax revenues on profits between individual countries when an enterprise operates in several countries and uses a uniform profit tax calculation.
costep_1998-01-16_3_4	Mr President, this initiative - which this House will undoubtedly approve - should allow us to make a first consideration: how community budget needs to be calculated in the European Development Fund. We would insist on this in the proposal for the Union to make its foreign affairs policy more and more united. Direct budgetary control of these funds would make the European Union’s actions even more efficient. What doubt can there be about the demand for a sustained or efficient development, in many cases, the cancellation of a debt when it becomes impossible for a country to repay this debt and the interest payments without putting its future economic development at risk. To insist on forcing certain countries to make impossible repayments renders development aid, as well as economic reforms, unviable. The high level of debt in some countries has, moreover, a deterrent effect on investment, leads to the flight of capital, makes its production become excessively export-orientated causing imbalances, the abandonment of rural areas and even domestic shortages. It also has a knock-on effect on the very political stability of these Third World countries. Let us not talk now about those democracies which are just emerging from what was previously an authoritarian regime. Therefore, I think that - as the Committee proposes - maintaining aid to countries like Burundi, Ethiopia, Guinea Bissau, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nigeria, Uganda, São Tomé e Principe, the former Zaire, Zambia and Uganda is something that this House should support. We cannot demand from these Third World countries that they put the repayment of their debt before their own economic growth. We have to make sure the debt repayment is compatible with the autonomous development of these countries if we do not want to take with one hand and give with the other, on the basis of increasing humanitarian and development aid.
costep_2001-12-17_3_29	Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Parliament wanted this Convention, and now we have got it. We share in this success, and have you to thank for it having been possible. The Convention’s flaws have been alluded to here several times, but we can and will take care that these blemishes are insignificant and will be forgotten by the time the work is done. My second remark follows on from what Mr Nassauer said: the Convention puts Parliament, too, in a new position of responsibility. The reform of the institutions is, for the first time, in our hands too. We bear responsibility no longer only for the demands and visions that we develop here, but also for the compromises and results. That is something new and we will have to get used to it. My third point is that the Convention has been given the broad mandate we wanted it to have. That is an opportunity and a danger in equal measure. The Convention must not turn itself into an expanded Intergovernmental Conference, but likewise it must not reduce itself to the level of being just a forum for discussion. It must work towards broad consensus and must concentrate its attention on those strategic proposals for reform that point the way ahead to future developments and open up the road that leads to them. Fourthly, the word 'constitution' is now to be found for the first time in an official Council document, which is quite something. It is not certain whether a draft constitution will be the final result, but what we can be sure of is that the Convention must direct all its efforts at what we - borrowing the expression of that great European, the German philosopher Immanuel Kant - might call the Convention’s categorical imperative, that every one of its proposals must also be capable of becoming a basic component of a European constitution. It is towards that goal that it must work. Fifthly, Europe is becoming ever more important, yet of decreasing interest to its own citizens. They are, admittedly, not yet opposed to the European Union, but they are no longer so sure why they are meant to be in favour of it. We want Europe’s citizens to regain the knowledge of why we are uniting Europe. The European Union must stand for a European model of society and for a European world vision. What we are about is Europe’s self-assertion - economic, political and, not least, cultural - and the preservation of a European way of life! This has acquired an added dimension since 11 September. The EU could be sunk by this new challenge, but it could grow through it - indeed, I am quite sure that it will. Applause
costep_2009-11-25_12_54	Madam President, Commissioner, please allow me to thank you for your dedicated work on the enlargement of the European Union. The European Union has had a powerful impact in the western Balkans over the last two years on democratic change and economic deregulation. The visa waiver for some countries in the western Balkans and the start of the accession negotiations for FYROM mark progress which European citizens will benefit from, both as a result of judicial and police cooperation with the EU and from an economic perspective. I believe that during the current time of economic crisis, the EU enlargement process offers a solution for revitalising the European Union’s economy. However, we must not forget the adverse consequences arising from the unfair benefits offered by the European Union to different countries in the western Balkans region. The Commission must also look closely at including Moldova in the group of countries in the western Balkans as the aid offered to neighbouring countries to help implement the necessary reforms must continue in a fair manner. Moldova is a potential candidate, prepared to come into line with the European Union as part of the political and economic integration process.
costep_2011-06-23_14_142	I am voting for this report, given that the current Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and São Tomé and Príncipe has been in force since 2006 and that the protocol for this agreement expired on 31 May 2011. This new protocol with São Tomé and Príncipe of 15 June 2010, for the 2011-2014 period, therefore makes complete sense, and Parliament must give its consent. The protocol provides for a Union contribution to São Tomé and Príncipe of EUR 682 500 per year, of which EUR 227 500 will go towards support for São Tomé and Príncipe’s fisheries policy, which I believe to be appropriate. I also welcome the fact that the new protocol includes a suspension clause in case of a breach of human rights.
costep_2011-01-19_7_183	Despite the low number of countries that have accepted the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), this demonstrates Europe’s commitment to supporting the development of Pacific countries by using a mechanism that goes beyond mere aid procedures and seeks to mobilise local economies, which hope to have the effect of creating businesses and jobs, and bringing about the greater movement of people and goods. Although I agree in principle with such an instrument, I cannot ignore my doubts about the impact that the EPA may have on the fisheries industry. I would therefore like the Commission to look at this issue with particular care, and I believe that the Commission’s presentation of a report to Parliament on fishing in the Pacific and the management of the region’s fish stocks is justified, as requested by the rapporteur.
costep_1997-11-05_3_39	Madam President, the debate on the paralys of French roads is almost an annual ritual. Previous speakers have referred to a number of issues relating to freedom of movement. I think it is a good thing we have Commissioner Kinnock in this post at this time. Of course, I do not imagine Commissioner Kinnock leading a Commission cavalry charge to liberate the Lille-Brussels road. That is not his job. I do not see him as an agent of the repression of French workers in a latter-day Germinal. However, I know him well enough to expect him to bring forward an ambitious initiative to ensure that a major Community social policy in the transport field can be implemented. Commissioner Kinnock can take this opportunity to launch such an ambitious policy.
costep_2010-10-20_7_344	Adopting the euro was a gamble of fundamental importance for the EU. The main risk factor is associated not so much with matters of monetary technique, where the European Central Bank is doing an excellent job, but with economic cohesion and the link with the real economy. The problem really made itself felt during the crisis: the single currency makes less and less sense for a market that is still fragmentary and with fiscal policies that are not always sufficiently homogeneous. Considering these issues should not be, and must not be, a mere exercise or excuse for claiming legal sovereignty over matters that are currently the responsibility of individual nations. Instead, it is useful to apply consistency and a systematic approach to economic action in the face of increasingly complex situations, where currency challenges are not the same as in the past and require different instruments and objectives where the responsibilities shouldered by the technicians must be backed by ongoing and consistent monitoring as well as political direction based on a considered view of the future and an eye to resolving contingent problems.
costep_2003-04-09_3_154	We abstained on the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, but this does not mean we hold any grievance against the people of Cyprus. Rather, we reproach the leaders of the European Union for their irresponsibility. We have resigned ourselves to admitting a divided country to the European Union. This country has unresolved problems relating to its very existence. We regret this situation, which is further proof if any were needed of the European Union’s inability to demonstrate real political will. The accession of Cyprus clearly ought to have been dependent on its reunification. Instead of making this a condition of entry, and using the accession of Cyprus as a lever, the European Union contents itself with supposedly deploring the fact that it is opening its doors to a divided country. The mind boggles! This is yet another wasted opportunity. It means that a country under foreign occupation will be allowed to join the European Union. It will give Turkey another way of continuously blackmailing the European Union. It will fix the de facto external border of the Union at the green line. The latter is not recognised by the European Union, or by any other country other than Turkey!
costep_2011-02-16_11_36	Madam President, market fluctuations are important for the proper functioning of markets in order to create incentives for the buying and selling of goods. For us farmers, commodity futures trading is a basic component of the buying and selling of harvested crops. It provides an important opportunity to achieve planning certainty through the early setting of prices and quantities. In contrast to the situation in our prosperous industrialised nations, rising food prices are a particular problem in the poor regions of the world where people have to spend a large proportion of their income on food. We must not intervene in the markets every time the prices change in an attempt to combat natural fluctuations. However, without internationally applicable framework legislation for the financial markets, we cannot even start to think about regulating the commodities markets, because if there is too much money in the financial market it will find suitable equivalents, and commodities are currently highly regarded. Therefore, we should not be surprised if agricultural commodities are now also a sought-after trading objective.
costep_2010-06-15_8_166	The Internet has become part of daily life for millions of people, and today it plays an irreplaceable role as a means of communication and as a vehicle for transmitting information and knowledge. The exponential increase in content on the Internet has made it a tool with many uses, and these uses are multiplying. Simultaneously, however, it has also become the setting for a new type of crime that benefits from the speed and dematerialisation of information flows and the massive volume of personal data made available by network users. I share the concerns included in the resolution on the need to address restrictions on Internet access for political reasons as well as bringing about greater security for children and adolescents in using the network. I agree with the view that the use and ongoing management of the network should be up to private individuals, but I believe that the Member States cannot exempt themselves from being present and active in a regulatory role. The aim of this would be primarily to prevent the abuse and violation of citizens' rights.
costep_1997-07-14_5_9	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you, know a few days ago Commissioner Emma Bonino, at a press conference, stated that there had been cases of fraudulent exports of beef from the United Kingdom. I think that there are various reasons why we should discuss this matter in plenary session. First of all, the information given by the Commissioner was imprecise and incomplete, which only added to media speculation and raised concerns among the public at large. The European Association for Consumer Protection reported on this. Secondly, the Commission’s information came late in the day. Two months before this press conference the Standing Veterinary Committee informed the Commission of these facts. Thirdly, as the Commissioner informed the press, albeit without enough detail and without giving all the necessary information, she should now at least inform this Chamber - if possible, with complete information this time. Fourthly, it was situations of this type that turned the mad cows crisis into such a serious matter. We must not repeat past mistakes and therefore should discuss this situation at once. Fifthly, I think that this subject, brought to light by the Commissioner, Bonino, lies outside the competences of the BSE monitoring committee. There is no link between the two. For all these reasons I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to agree to our request for a Commission statement on Thursday on the fraudulent export of beef from the United Kingdom.
costep_2007-10-10_17_2	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution is a response to an invitation by the European Council in June. Article 9 A of the draft Treaty states that in future the composition of the Parliament will be a matter for secondary legislation. This will be a decision of the European Council, adopted by unanimity, on the initiative of the European Parliament and with its consent. The Council is inviting us to explain how this procedure should work. It wants to see us deal with this hot potato. For our Parliament, this is a real political challenge. Are we capable of coming up with a reform that applies to ourselves? The last time we were asked to do this was in 2000, and Parliament did not manage to do it. For this reason the vote secured in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is already a remarkable political result. We obtained a large majority: two thirds in the final vote and three quarters on the main point, the distribution of seats, in terms of actual numbers, between the Member States. What is the problem we are facing? We should first remember that the current Parliament of 785 MEPs no longer complies with the new legal position resulting from the amended Treaty of Nice. It is this system that would apply, based on 736 MEPs, in the absence of any new decision. Up to now, in the Council and in Parliament, the Member States have been divided into categories: one supersize state, some large ones, some medium-sized, some small, etc. Each category has the same voting rights in the Council and the same number of seats in Parliament. This is over! The future Treaty introduces two types of innovation in relation to this system. On the one hand, there are actual figures: a maximum of 750 MEPs, a ceiling of 96 and a minimum of 6 seats per Member State. On the other, there is a principle: between the maximum and minimum, the Member States must be represented according to degressive proportionality, and it is our job in Parliament to define this principle today, namely to choose how much proportionality and how much degressivity there is, or how over-represented the least populous countries are and how under-represented the most populous countries are. Your committee is proposing that this principle should be translated in the following way: firstly, the minimum and maximum numbers set by the Treaty must be fully utilised. In particular, the use of the ceiling of 750 seats will give us a small reserve -as it were - of seats, so degressive proportionality can be applied without reducing the number of seats of any country. This is a fundamental political choice, and is absolutely necessary to obtain unanimity in the European Council. Secondly, the larger the population of a country, the greater its entitlement to a large number of seats, of course. Thirdly, the larger the population of a country, the more inhabitants are represented by each of its Members of the European Parliament. So at present, a Spanish MEP represents more than 875 000 people, Mr President, while a German MEP represents only 832 000. Up to now, Germany has had twice the population of Spain. This anomaly will be put right by the allocation of four additional seats to Spain. In total, ten countries are affected by the proposed increases. We are fully aware of the fact that this is only a temporary solution. It would be desirable to come up with some sort of mathematical formula that would automatically apply to any future enlargements, but the tight timescale given to us did not allow this. However, the resolution makes some recommendations on this point. Similarly, we had to use the only population figures available, those from Eurostat, since we did not have any figures from the citizens themselves. Adrian Severin will say more about this. Finally, we would warn our fellow members against amendments that contradict the fundamental principles of the report and will have the effect, depending on the case, of giving the large countries an abnormal advantage over the smaller countries or small countries over the large countries, in which case our work will have been in vain, because without unanimity in the Council we will have to stick with the 736 seats of the Treaty of Nice. So, ladies and gentlemen, please refrain from bidding up your countries. We have spent the afternoon proclaiming that we are the only democratic institution protecting the interests of Europeans before the other institutions, above national egotism. Now, today, we have the perfect opportunity to show that our actions are faithful to our words. Applause
costep_2001-03-12_8_4	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent weeks and months when agriculture has been debated, there has been much talk of a change of direction in agricultural policy. I certainly do not wish to address these topical problems here, but I do think that some aspects of the debate have been neglected. What I am getting at is the fact that surely it can hardly be right to pillory the whole of European agriculture right across the board or to condemn wholesale the achievements of the common agricultural policy. The European sugar market policy, of all policies, has done nothing to deserve a judgement of this kind. The common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector is like a horse on the road to victory, as has also been repeatedly stressed in this debate. For many years now, consumers have been supplied with a safe basic foodstuff, and this at reasonable prices. Some critics think and claim that sugar is too expensive, however. Mr Daul referred to this, but it should set alarm bells ringing; firstly, because these critics are hardly concerned about the well-being of consumers but about their own profits; secondly, because the production of a basic foodstuff in compliance with European environmental and social standards has a legitimate price and thirdly, because, measured against consumers' purchasing power worldwide, the sugar price which we have in Europe can probably also be described as one of the lowest. Some people also say that the common organisation of the market in sugar is a dinosaur. It has been in force for 32 years, since 1968, but of course it has been repeatedly adapted. That is why it is now also necessary to have a longer period of validity, of at least five years, as the rapporteur, Mr Daul, has said. It would be wrong to change the compensation system for storage costs The President cut the speaker off
costep_2011-01-19_7_49	The directive on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare is a vital step towards patient mobility within the European Union. It is aimed at clarifying and assisting access to cross-border and good quality healthcare, along with the patient’s right to reimbursement by the Member State of affiliation, thus also promoting cooperation between the Member States. Moreover, there are clear advantages for patients, especially those suffering from rare and complex diseases, since it will be possible to diagnose and treat them in the most suitable Member State. Such mobility will also enable patients to legitimately avoid national waiting lists, taking advantage of the medical services on offer in other EU countries. This directive will enable all patients to benefit from a certain number of rights which have already been recognised by the Court of Justice of the European Union. This is undoubtedly a step forward in the process of European integration, in strengthening solidarity, and in a Europe which is focused on its citizens. I voted in favour of this report for these reasons.
costep_2009-02-18_20_10	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wholeheartedly support any initiative aimed at developing the Union for the Mediterranean. From this perspective, I hope to see the parliamentary role of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly strengthened, including by stepping up the Assembly’s relations with the Mediterranean partners and enabling it to make recommendations to meetings of Foreign Ministers and to participate as an observer at meetings of Heads of State or Government, ministerial meetings and preparatory meetings held by senior officials. I would like to emphasise the need to strengthen the role and initiatives of the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership and to create a EuroMediterranean Investment Bank, which was announced some time ago but which has not yet been carried out. I support the proposal to create a Euro-Mediterranean Regional and Local Assembly along the lines of similar, European, institutions, in order to involve regions and cities further, and a Euro-Mediterranean Economic and Social Committee to involve the social partners and civil society. I also welcome the proposal to establish a Euro-Mediterranean Energy Community within the framework of a policy aimed at implementing large-scale projects in the fields of renewable energy and energy infrastructure. Furthermore, I hope that the Union will play an ever-more effective role in the search for peace, in conflict resolution, in the strengthening of democracy, in the defence of religious freedom and in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking, organised crime and people trafficking. Lastly, the Union cannot evade the task of taking concerted action with the states involved to manage migratory policies and flows in the Mediterranean area. It can no longer focus solely on security, the rule of law and repressing illegal immigration, but must also, and above all, direct its attention to active policies, sources of shared rules and targeted and sustainable employment.
costep_1998-01-14_10_6	Mr President, on the committee I supported the rejection of the report for the following reasons: Mr Sainjon speaks of the information society. In so doing he obscures from view the issue of global capitalism. The report mentions a regulated economy without offering any further explanation. We forget that a regulated economy is founded on the logic of capital. There must always be the highest possible return on capital. Capitalism is both a process to increase the value of capital and a social order structured round it. The European Union is the modern version of capitalism in Europe. Mass unemployment is an element in this system, in which European policies create a free working environment to exploit and manipulate people in the name of capital. We export this culture to other countries in the shape of company relocations and massive investment programmes. The report obfuscates the issue of capital, the profit-driven process, and sanctifies the market forces. The rapporteur has forgotten that the free market is often at odds with human dignity, and even requires us to ignore it all together. This explains why companies relocate to where the return on capital is greatest. That capitalism standardizes all, making everything uniform, is something Asia, for which it was once an alien culture, has recently learnt. Capitalism is not civilization or humanism, but the crude and ruthless pursuit of profit. Consider this: there is sixty times more loose cash circulating around the world that what would be required to pay off all world trade debts. Company relocations account for some of the latest expenses of capitalism. It is the world’s casino, where the stake is often the dignity of the poor.
costep_2002-12-16_1_71	Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs would like to join the others and extend its best wishes for a speedy recovery to Mrs Damião, the original rapporteur, and also congratulate Mr Hughes on his work as the deputy and much more. I think that we are talking in terms of adding the all-important, finishing touches to a directive that mainly deals with the position of employees. I am actually of the same mind as Mr Meijer, but I should like to repeat that it is relevant to all kinds of other categories of people who are involved, and we must certainly do something about this situation. These are my comments on Directive 83/477/EC. Like Mr Hughes, I am pleased that the impending deadlock, caused by the fact that Parliament’s amendments had not been adopted, has been staved off thanks to an excellent contribution by the Council in the form of a common position and additional amendments that are somewhat more far-reaching. This actually means that we have made a great deal of progress and that asbestos of any kind, albeit by-products or production, has been banned, and this finally after 25 years. I conclude from this that we, given the incubation time of 25 years or longer, must apply the precautionary principle more forcefully. I would refer to a few areas we have done absolutely nothing about, such as electromagnetic waves, optical radiation, OPS, softeners and their use. Not only should we tackle these products, we should also consider the use to which they are put in production processes. This automatically leads to the need for legislation and directives in those countries, but also sanctions, hence also an amendment. In addition, the partners should be involved; this all seems to make perfect sense to me. Who, though, maintains law and order in practice? Surely it is the trade union officials, workers who sit on works councils, sometimes specialist services in large companies, and they need to be able to fall back on something. This is why we need to focus on this in our forthcoming Health and Safety programme. Finally, I should like to see a register drawn up of those buildings, and in that sense, I would endorse Mr Meijer. This is, in fact, what we had asked for, but the Council, because of difficulties, did not immediately accept it. We shall therefore liaise with the Council and try to reach either a solution in terms of national registers or a solution in a different way, so that we know of the buildings we are talking about. I am familiar with one of them: the Commission building, but that has been razed to the ground.
costep_1998-01-15_4_7	Mr President, we meet here today to discuss an important question. For months, negotiations with Switzerland have been at a standstill because of the transport problem. We therefore urgently need to take stock of the progress of our relationship with our Alpine neighbour. It seems that the Swiss authorities have agreed to make concessions. We therefore would like the Commission to give us some specific information on progress, which has been mentioned in the press. In fact, the problem of crossing Switzerland is of some consequence with regard to road traffic in the whole of the Alps. For that reason, I and the whole of my group consider that the EU’s relationship with Switzerland with regard to transport cannot be isolated from the overall context of Alpine transit, and that the disastrous effects of the increase in road traffic on the environment must be taken into consideration urgently. Let me give a single example: the level of pollution in the valley of Chamonix is as high as in a large town because of the Mont Blanc Tunnel. It is therefore understandable that the inhabitants of the Mont-Blanc area, and also the Val d'Aosta area, should express concern with regard to the possible construction of a second tunnel. However, there are solutions. First of all, settling the dispute with Switzerland and setting up a pricing system, which will encourage the use of pollution control equipment. Secondly, and this is a very important aspect, promoting rail transport and developing piggyback transport systems. Of course, the changeover from road to rail will be expensive, and will necessitate large investments. But do not let us forget that this is a solution for the future. Within this context, the Lyon to Turin HST link, including freight transport, when the Monmélian to Turin rail tunnel is built, will facilitate combined transport in the Alps. It is therefore necessary to make this project a reality and for the Member States to commit themselves to building the necessary infrastructures. Furthermore, special attention should be paid to the rail project linking Geneva via Mâcon, Bourg-en-Bresse or Chambéry. The new President of the Swiss Republic has made optimistic remarks on the future relationship between the European Union and Switzerland. Let us hope that it will enable us to sort out this difficult situation.
costep_2011-03-09_7_7	Mr President, the first point that I think needs to be stressed here follows on from what my colleague, Mr Brok, said about the involvement of the EU institutions and what Parliament is requesting from the Council with this report: namely, that the EU institutions and the Community method be involved in resolving this issue of the permanent stability mechanism of the stability fund. The report calls specifically for this involvement, while respecting the role of the Commission. This is essential for Parliament, and I believe that it is essential for this mechanism. The second point, and it is one that is very important for us, is that the stability fund is only one of the factors. Economic governance and, potentially, EU matters are other factors in resolving the financial and economic crisis that is currently plaguing some of the euro area Member States, and therefore, the Council should be aware that the fund does not solve everything by itself, and that it must be integrated into economic governance mechanisms and into the Europe 2020 growth strategy. Having said that, I would like to highlight three very important paragraphs of the report: paragraph 6, which involves all Member States regardless of their size; paragraph 12, which states that access to the fund cannot be denied to any state based on its small size; and paragraph 14, which I believe to be the most important, as it establishes, on the one hand, that interest rates must be offered on favourable terms, so that there is not a repeat of what is currently happening with Greece and Ireland, whose problems are not being solved by aid from the EU or International Monetary Fund. It is vital that there be favourable conditions and a back-to-back approach without margins on borrowing costs, so that the financial crises in the most fragile Member States can be resolved.
costep_2000-07-06_10_12	Madam President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to endorse what Mrs Maij-Weggen stated. It is vital to support the Wahid government at present. In plain terms - and I think the European Commission and the Council are taking a sensible stance here- this support entails tracking down specific resources in order to support that government in its attempt to pacify and to actively intervene. This is our urgent request. We are also very critical of the situation in that region and very concerned for the Moluccan community in the Netherlands. We particularly empathise with the emotional turmoil and anxiety they are experiencing. We are in favour of granting Wahid support, because the moment we involve international observers or commit other forms of aid without Wahid’s knowledge, we will be intervening and undermining his actions. In this sense, I clearly endorse the PPE’s stance and would strongly urge this House to show great concern, and great willingness to provide support, but via Wahid, and also prescribe requirements to be met, again via him, because we need to play the game through him for the time being.
costep_2000-03-15_2_26	Mr President, the annual reports on human rights, racism and xenophobia give the House an excellent opportunity to make a critical or, to be more precise, a self-critical appraisal of the countries in the European Union. Candidate countries and their Members of Parliament, and I am thinking of many a member of the Turkish parliament, have a great deal to learn, such as how independent representatives of the people act and must act when it comes to human rights in their own country. We have to admit, however, that we still have a lot of homework to do. Self-criticism is not enough. It does us credit, but alone it does not suffice. Although, in our reports, we condemn cases of torture and maltreatment of detainees or prisoners by the forces of order or officials in charge of executing sentences, we must admit that so far little has been done about it by those in a position of responsibility. The same applies to the way in which many refugees are treated in many Member States. How many more times do we intend to debate the conditions in numerous detention centres as a problem of which we are aware but which has yet to be regulated? If we want to win the people in the detention centres over to our society, then we must admit that most European detention centres are not at present suitably equipped for the task. We are right to criticise human rights violations and discrimination in candidate countries such as Turkey or some of the Eastern European countries when it comes to the Roma and other minorities, but that is precisely why we must set an example when it comes to human rights in the European Union. In this sense, thank you.
costep_2006-10-25_16_5	Mr President, Commissioner, a moment ago I was saying to the rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, that, so far tonight, all of the speakers in this debate have been women. Then they will say that transport is only of interest to men. Perhaps NAIADES inspires us, and perhaps the Commissioner should take note and appoint two women coordinators for NAIADES. Let us return to serious issues though, and the report by Mrs Wortmann-Kool. In principle, we formally support the Integrated European Action Programme for Inland Waterways, known as 'NAIADES', and the idea of giving it a greater political profile. It is true, and we have noted this, that the use of inland waterways varies a lot throughout Europe, from 0.1%, in countries like the United Kingdom, Italy, and even a little less in my country, to 40% in the Netherlands, which has a greater number of these waterways. Unfortunately, in some cases canals and rivers have been abandoned. Admirable attempts at recovery are being made, however. In my country, due to its mountainous nature, canals and rivers are used more for carrying irrigation and drinking water than for transport, but we nevertheless are aware of and support the initiatives relating to the navigable stretch of the Guadalquivir from Seville to the sea, which is also hoping to be included in the trans-European network. Furthermore, I am also delighted by the current efforts of my city, Zaragoza, which will host Expo 2008 and which, within that context, wishes - and this has been proposed within the context of the objective of promoting water and sustainable development - to restore the navigability of the River Ebro. We are therefore pleased to be able to include ourselves in this European project. We are talking about sustainable development when we refer to inland waterways' potential to help reduce the impact of CO2 emissions by up to 75% compared to roads and also - and this is why it is so important - to promote this inland waterways network at European level and to support new formulae so that this sector can be more competitive and efficient. Mrs Wortmann-Kool has done an excellent job as rapporteur, and we are eagerly awaiting the Commission’s coming proposals to enhance the economic and competitive impact of this new sector. We particularly support the strengthening of infrastructures. That is to say, for thousands of kilometres of inland waterways and hundreds of inland ports, with lock infrastructures, etc., which have already been named, to finally become a connection network that strengthens regional and territorial cohesion. To this end, some of the amendments that we presented in committee and which have been included propose greater inclusion of this sector in the trans-European network programmes. We have also proposed supporting river information services, which we believe will very much increase the efficiency and safety of the sector. Furthermore, we believe that it is an excellent idea to obtain greater economic support for the sector’s potential for container traffic, although there are still great deficiencies here. In the report on logistics, which I hope to be able to present to this House, I will clearly also include Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s proposals on improving logistical aspects and innovation and technological progress for reducing operational costs.
costep_2000-06-14_6_47	Mr President, I voted for this report on the exchange on information regarding, specifically, financial activities. But I would like to accompany this vote with two questions: firstly, who inspects the inspectors, and secondly, why does the European Parliament not extend its controls - as I would advocate - to cover all the uses to which the citizens' money is put, including the money used to finance pension funds? The Members of the Pensioners' Party are not yet aware of how the money from contributions which should boost their pensions is spent. I feel that this directive should be extended to include this type of inspection. Lulling report A5-0144/2000
costep_2009-05-05_6_69	I voted in favour. Speaking of energy consumption policies, the EU should take the statements made by the renowned British economist Nicholas Stern as a guide to its choices: 'There are more incentives to invest in energy efficiency during a recession and when oil prices are high. Spending on renewable and other low-carbon industries could help stimulate the economy'. It would be useful to try and create an energy policy able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to keep faith with the agreements taken under the Kyoto protocol and to support the EU’s guiding role in combating climate change. Implementing this protocol would make a very important contribution to employment and also to competitiveness in the economic and social field. Although industry and consumers' associations are in favour of the current Directive 92/75/EEC on energy labelling, it cannot be said to have kept pace with technological developments and with innovation in the energy market because, first and foremost, there is a need to move forward from this situation of inertia throughout Europe so that a new dimension can be opened up in the lives of users.
costep_1998-04-29_14_5	Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of my group I would like to thank Mr Monfils for his splendid report. The notion that Melina Mercouri put forward thirteen years ago regarding the City of Culture event has been an undoubted success. By the year 2000 all Member States of the Union will have their own City of Culture year planned. Actually, Finland is the only country that is having to share its designated City of Culture year with eight other cities. There is nothing there can be done about this in itself, but I seriously think that Finland too, and perhaps especially, given her status as a relatively unknown new Member State, should have had her own individual City of Culture celebration. Helsinki should have got her own City of Culture year considering her internationally respected, and at the same time totally indigenous, contribution to the Arts, as well as the cultural arrangements that are now being undertaken in preparation for the year 2000. Sharing the City of Culture among many only serves to water down each city’s visible contribution to cultural development. In future programming the City of Culture status must clearly only be awarded to one city at a time. The most important contribution the City of Culture project can make is, in the end, its permanent influence on society, and it is therefore necessary to try to get the community as a whole involved in events, to take part in them and get something out of them. It is then that the influence the event has will carry on in an active and creative way long after the year in question is over. The City of Culture year must be mainly based on the city’s own resources and special features, its history and its challenges in the face of change. You can then build a selected theme on that individual cultural base, taking advantage of reciprocal action and cultural offerings on an international basis. The birth of lasting cultural cooperation is one of the key goals of the Union. Although cooperation among different cities is to be aspired to, it is the essential responsibility of just one city, and, if it likes, that city can adopt a natural partner to help in the formulation of its City of Culture year, a partner that has something in common with its geographical situation, history or culture: one of the applicant countries, for instance. I hope the Commission will continue to develop the European City of Culture notion, which is a splendid opportunity, for example, for associate countries to develop their cultural heritage and creativity.
costep_2001-09-04_10_8	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join in congratulating the Commission on its negotiating tactics and success. I think it is as the Commissioner said: the protocol has been saved. Obviously, this in itself will not solve the problems. The problems inherent in climate change and what needs to be done to stop climate change go far beyond what was agreed in Bonn. But it is an important first step. We must counter those who criticise the Kyoto protocol in principle - a number of members from Germany, for example, have said that the whole protocol is useless - and those who, as environmental politicians, have said it is useless because it does not go far enough, by saying that, if your house is on fire and you think it will take ten fire engines to put it out, you are hardly going to turn the first fire engine away and say, please do not start fighting the fire until all ten fire engines are here; you do what you can as quickly as possible, bearing in mind that other measures are needed. These other measures are being negotiated both at international level and, of course, in the European Union. Now we have to tackle the question of implementation. You made a number of important announcements on that today, Commissioner, and you have our support. We must keep talking to the Americans at international level. A lot of people, including here in Parliament, are hugely critical of the Americans because of their policy in just about every political arena. I think we should concentrate on fundamentals. We should make it clear to our American friends that we do not agree with them on numerous counts but that we can live with our differences. However, in this area, we Europeans cannot live with the fact that the Americans keep holding back. And we need to tell them as much again and again.
costep_2010-12-15_17_15	Madam President, NATO has, indeed, emerged from the Lisbon Summit in a stronger position. Article 5 has been revived and does not preclude the ability to mount a defence against a ballistic attack. The provisions of the new strategy must now be put into effect. The plan of action on the transatlantic missile defence architecture should be completed not later than the middle of 2011. This should also be backed up by money, including from the European partners in NATO. The signing by Russia of a new START treaty must not mean restrictions on building the NATO antimissile architecture. In addition, cooperation with Russia in this area must not mean a weakening of the defence of Central Europe.
costep_1997-03-10_5_16	I do not think I am a cow either, as Mr Nassauer pointed out about my colleague, Mr Schulz. I think it is something which unites us not only with the socialists but with everyone in this hemicycle, but that is not why I am pleased not to be checked. However, when I see labels entitling my luggage to travel through airports, whilst I on the other hand, have to show my identity card or my passport, I do feel a little perplexed. Evidently, as has been mentioned here, Schengen is a step forward towards freedom of movement and we are not going to deny that. But it is such a cautious step and above all so unclear that some of us are concerned about it. We have moved forward it is true, but how? With exclusively intergovernmental agreements which it is difficult for the European Parliament to check and for the national parliaments to control in view of their extra-national nature. We are anxious to know whether we are to continue like this or, as has been said so often, whether we are to have a Community legal basis which will help us to take those matters forward. The report therefore seems to me to be opportune and I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the content. Flexibility has been mentioned here. Flexibility to move forward. We might discuss that, but in principle we should be in agreement. So to move forward, but how? I think we need to move towards greater democracy, more rights, more freedoms and, above all, without agreements between the Governments placing too much emphasis on certain problems, for example immigration. I know it is a problem, but we cannot work simply by stressing only the security or frontiers aspect to press for 'solutions' which are to say the least not very transparent. Yes to doing the right thing by the citizens; yes to fulfilling the promise we made - and I include myself in the 'we' as one of those with an interest in seeing this European Union progress; yes to the promise we made for a free and open European Union in which we can travel; yes to being able to call upon the Court of Justice of the Union to uphold that; yes to as flexible a Union as is desired, but one which is moving forward, not towards a scenario in which - as seems to be the case in the CIS - we should have little to offer with the States nevertheless rapidly reaching agreement saying 'don't worry, at least as regards security, your security, we shall reach agreement; yes indeed, just don't tell us how', but rather towards a scenario of greater democracy.
costep_2007-03-14_6_22	I voted in favour of the report on social services of general interest. I welcome the continuity and consistency of Parliament’s vote, in the sense that it demands legal certainty and clarification of the Community framework to be applied to social services of general interest. I believe that this report enables a balance to be struck between the application of Community law in the strictest sense of the word and the accomplishment of tasks in the field of social services of general interest. This is in fact a preliminary step needed in order to establish a sectoral directive on social services of general interest, which Parliament clearly requested in the Rapkay report on the White Paper on services of general interest. Furthermore, I welcome the proposal to convene a forum on social services of general interest initiated by Parliament and call for it to be implemented in practice under the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union.
costep_2010-05-05_14_358	There are times when environmental well-being, protection of natural heritage and human welfare generally manage to gain the upper hand even over economic and partisan interests. This is highlighted by this resolution. The European Parliament has managed to show today that it defends, first and foremost, the general interests and welfare of people. The use of cyanide technologies in mining poses a risk which we cannot afford to take as the effects are irreversible. However, I support the idea of encouraging industrial reconversion in areas where mining based on cyanide technologies has been banned, by providing sufficient financial support for 'clean' industrial sectors, as well as for renewable energy and tourism.
costep_1998-11-17_4_25	Mr President, I too must thank the rapporteur very warmly for all his hard work and for the report he has put together for us in so short a time. It is not really possible to work in these conditions. Perhaps that explains his attack on our amendments. We were of course not happy with some parts of the report. We also abstained in the committee meeting. Consequently we felt obliged to retable the amendments on the points in question. That does not mean of course that all the compromises reached are lost. But we were in the extremely awkward position of having to make amendments on the basis of a report which did not yet exist. It just means we shall have to find another solution in future, though I appreciate that the rapporteur himself cannot do anything about it. As regards the subject itself: happily unemployment is slightly down for the first time, but that does not mean of course that this will continue to be the case in future. There are a few dark clouds on the horizon. So we must continue with the strategy we have started. I should say really that this strategy has been far more successful than anyone could have expected beforehand. There was a good deal of cynicism about this strategy, but it appears to work. It really seems to be leading to change in the Member States. Perhaps not enough change, but at least some. A number of things are now threatening, some of which are actually in Mr van Velzen’s report. Paragraph 7 and the broad investment programme is something which we cannot accept, because it would take us back to the whole discussion on the overall strategy. We previously rejected this kind of broad investment programme, firstly because there is no money and, secondly, because it does not work at European level. It is hard for us to agree to it now, even if we do have eleven prime ministers in the European Union with a socialist background. It does not automatically mean that we are going to cough up. The second point I wanted to raise is the question of taxes. I think it quite proper that the rapporteur should ask for that to be addressed. It is a great shame that the debate on this, specifically variations in the rate of VAT, went totally awry in the Council and that governments which were supposedly in favour and are doing nothing else about it, and the one or two governments which were against, appear to be getting their own way. I think it is a great pity. I hope the European Parliament will manage to get the matter raised again. These are the main points. We may be able to back this provided we do not radically change it all of a sudden, and provided enough of our amendments are adopted.
costep_2002-09-24_2_105	Mr President, what purpose do the cosmetics with which many women beautify themselves serve? One poor elderly pensioner said to me: 'I have beggared myself with these cosmetics which have made these women look so beautiful. I have spent all my money. Now I am penniless, a poor pensioner, but I am happy because I have enjoyed my life'. Another pensioner, however, said to me: 'I, on the other hand, resisted the temptations of these women who use cosmetics and now I am a rich pensioner, but I regret the fact that I too did not have a happier, more enjoyable life with more contact with beautiful women who use cosmetics.' I did not know what to do, so I looked at Mrs Roth-Behrendt, who I am sure uses cosmetics which have not been tested on animals. What a beautiful lady Mrs Roth-Behrendt is! It is patently obvious that the cosmetics she uses are useful, maybe even more so than those tested on animals. Well then, we must follow the example of Mrs Roth-Behrendt, and so I voted for the motion.
costep_1999-04-15_6_4	Mr President, in economic dealings, the customer usually has to pay a price for the goods or services he obtains. There is nothing wrong with this, and it is a rule that I think the whole of society accepts. But when it comes to using infrastructure, the link is often not obvious enough. The total costs of transport and the prices charged in many cases bear no relation to each other, and the Commission proposal is a laudable attempt to improve this situation. However, it is very questionable whether the proposed method of charging - the marginal social costs - will cover all the costs involved. The Commission is obviously trying to be fairly straightforward here. A number of Members have stressed that the introduction of a system of charges must not be allowed to lead to higher costs for the transport user. I would not go as far as this. The 'user pays' principle must come first, even if this means increasing prices. We must ensure that the costs are borne by the transport end-users, not just by the operators. If certain users are excluded from the system of charges, this will inevitably mean that the total costs cannot be completely covered. I therefore entirely agree with Amendment No 7 by Mr Lagendijk. The proposed charging method must produce a situation where the forms of transport that are least harmful to the environment have a greater share of the whole transport market, and it must therefore be possible to apply an amended version of the 'user pays' principle.
costep_2000-05-16_7_16	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, working time policy - as we can see once again - is not economic policy, it is health and safety at work policy. When used preventively, it saves the state and the economy a great deal of money. I have completely failed to understand in this debate why a reasonable set of rules was not adopted back in 1993, especially as the Commission and Parliament did not want any derogations even then. Seven million workers were affected and specific sectors, such as the mobile worker sector, have been subject to ruinous competition over recent years, especially in Germany. It is therefore also a social problem and it is not enough, Mr Crowley, to use tachographs or other technical aids. One does not exclude the other. We also need a framework directive, because the employees who are affected have been working in a grey zone for a long time now. They had no rules, they were not covered by a collective agreement, they were exploited and some also engaged in self-exploitation. We know that this overload sometimes gave rise to alcohol-related problems. Parliament has shown sufficient flexibility; Mrs Smet highlighted our legislative maturity. I think, Mrs Smet, you have proven that we can also fight. The results are acceptable. I am trying to muster support, even if we have not achieved everything we wanted to. But the transition period and the graduated plan are the maximum we have allowed the Council. I hope that no government will use up the full period of time and am counting on constructive competition between the Member States to see which State will be the first to implement the proposals from Parliament and the Commission.
costep_2002-10-23_3_61	In line with the Community instruments adopted recently to increase safety in civil aviation, the Parliament and Council proposal for a directive on occurrence reporting in civil aviation aims to guarantee the reporting of any situation specifically endangering an aircraft or its occupants. The data that is collected will facilitate information sharing, enabling lessons to be learnt in order to prevent accidents. I congratulate Mr Collins on the excellent report that he has drafted on this matter, which I fully support, in particular on the issue of confidentiality in the mandatory reporting of incidents, the only way of ensuring that human error is revealed in the potential occurrence of accidents, which rarely comes to light spontaneously, unlike technical faults, for example. I also wish to highlight the need to support the creation of reporting systems on a regional basis that would be linked to the integrated network of national incident reporting systems, thereby providing an entire region with information about various situations.
costep_2003-09-23_2_8	Mr President, together with the majority of my group and, in any event, all the French members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities (EDD), I will be voting against the appointment of Jean-Claude Trichet as President of the European Central Bank although I have been told that it is unusual to vote against one’s fellow countryman. Nevertheless, as we all saw, Mr Trichet renounced his nationality in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, saying 'I'm not a Frenchman' - in order to gain the good graces of the Commission, in which he appears to have succeeded. The reason for our opposition, however, goes deeper. Jean-Claude Trichet is, as every French person knows, one of the instigators of a policy that sacrifices, which has sacrificed and which continues to deliberately sacrifice growth to the Malthusian dogma of stability. For ten years we have been paying for the Central Bank’s monetary policy at a rate of one growth point per year and I must say that I am astonished, Mr Lipietz, that you have become such an ardent royalist. During the work of the European Convention, we and by 'we' I mean Mr Katiforis and many others, most of the socialists and the Greens, tried to change this dogma and to propose that, in the new European Constitution, as much ambition should be devoted to growth as to stability. We failed and I believe that this Parliament, at least those Members who took part in this struggle, would restore some pride by abstaining on Mr Trichet’s appointment, because he is so emblematic of this policy which has caused and which continues to cause so much damage, as we see on a daily basis, to the European economy.
costep_2004-10-25_1_89	Mr President, the rise in fuel prices affects many sectors of the European economy, and in particular transport-related sectors. Yet it is clear that the primary production sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries, are facing the most acute problems. This illustrates the unsatisfactory nature of our debate, in which we have bitten off more than we can chew. We should therefore focus on these two subjects. It is the fisheries sector which faces the most serious difficulties, and there are one or two extremely simple reasons for this. Within a little over one year, fishermen have seen the price of diesel oil double, with approximately one litre of fuel needed to catch one kilo of fish. This is why, together with the other Members of this House, I was quite literally shocked and appalled at the statements made by the Commissioner for Fisheries, in which he said that one need only pass the rise in the price of fuel on to the price of fish in order to solve the problems. This is of course impossible, and it is an example of the very kind of flawed reasoning which will dissuade consumers from buying fish, the very food we wish to promote. In my opinion, one of the lessons learnt from the crisis of 1993-1994, which caused a widespread breakdown of structures, was that extremely rapid action will be needed. The proposals we have just heard, in particular those put forward by Mrs Fraga and by the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Morillon, include placing a ceiling on the cost of diesel oil, reducing financial, social and tax costs and, most importantly, providing monetary advances which correspond to the needs of fishermen experiencing very serious problems, of whom there are already a large number. This is why we look to the Commission to adopt a position which is both easily understood and which is designed to prevent the breakdown of structures in areas which are heavily dependent on fishing. In other words, there is a need for both measures taken at European level during crisis periods and national measures adapted to local situations.
costep_2011-05-12_13_112	From time to time, this House produces reports whose titles leave no doubt about the fact that there will inevitably be nonsense in them! The Honeyball report is one of them. Pass over the usual paragraphs on the fate awaiting migrants, compulsory multiculturalism and the promotion of everything in the minority. The gem in this report is at paragraph 14. Fathers and mothers are thus 'equal partners in early childhood education and care'. Did I read 'partners'? Is it not their responsibility, first and foremost, to educate their own children? However it is true that, at paragraph 16, the rapporteur is calling for investment in parental education programmes. From the outset, parents are thus seen as incapable, irresponsible and childish. This impression is confirmed by paragraph 27, which stresses that, in the absence of adequate services for early childhood, our young children run the risk of falling into criminality and antisocial behaviour. Your trust in the human being is astounding and one wonders how mankind has been able to manage without you until now. No, really, the best favour you can do for our dear little darlings is to leave them in peace!
costep_2001-02-15_4_35	There are various causes of illegal immigration, but I believe that the main causes are, on the one hand, the desire to escape from the difficult situations many countries are now experiencing and to find a better standard of living, and, on the other, the construction of a Fortress Europe, which is making access to Member States' territory increasingly difficult for citizens of third countries. At the same time, like the rapporteur, I believe that the greatest offenders in illegal immigration are those who make financial profit from this process. As this is the case, we can only endorse the establishment of a punitive framework that will act as a sufficient deterrent, penalising not only the smugglers and traffickers of human beings, but also the employers who take advantage of this situation. Nevertheless, in addition to adopting these measures, we will have to carry out an effective assessment of the situation and implement measures designed to ensure the effective integration of these workers, guaranteeing them rights and social status rather than, as has increasingly been the case, the sudden expulsion of citizens who are discovered to be in an illegal situation.
costep_2011-03-24_7_382	Japan is overwhelmed today. One nuclear accident after another is coming on top of a natural disaster. This crisis is the most serious crisis that Japan has experienced since the Second World War. The victims number tens of thousands, and the material damage is considerable and still difficult to quantify. The European Union must deliver a response equal to the seriousness of the crisis. Japan has urgent need of aid. We urge the Commission to drive and coordinate the European solidarity effort. Europe’s action must be clear, rapid and efficient in the short and long term. As regards the Fukushima power station, European unease is legitimate. The European executive must respond to this by asking for a series of crash tests to be carried out in an independent and transparent way on all of Europe’s nuclear infrastructure. Finally, we cannot pass by without a collective reflection on our energy policy. On energy saving, renewable energy sources, the energy efficiency criterion, we expect ambitious and conclusive decisions from Europe, as we do on European research, often well below 3% of GDP.
costep_2009-12-16_3_40	Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the Swedish Presidency, particularly Prime Minister Reinfeldt, on behalf of both the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Portuguese delegation within the PPE Group. Our verdict on the Swedish Presidency is that it has been an almost total success, basically in four fundamental areas. Firstly, in the institutional area, the Swedish Presidency’s contribution to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, to the highly successful election of the President of the Commission and to everything associated with ratification was extremely professional and at the level that we expect for best practice in the European Union. Of course, for a country like Portugal, which played a decisive role in the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Swedish Presidency’s contribution was invaluable. My second point is the climate agenda, where, of course, the Commission’s efforts have also been extremely important In my view and that of many of my colleagues in the PPE, the climate change area is where the European Union has been most successful. It is at the very forefront of the global fight, and that is due to the efforts of both the Swedish Presidency and, in particular, the Commission Presidency. We consider these results to be very positive as well. My third point is financial regulation. Especially with this latest Council, there has been a step forwards that we regard as decisive and which may have a great impact on our emergence from the crisis. I would therefore also like to pass on our congratulations for having achieved an agreement in that area. Lastly, I would like to mention an area that is very important to me personally: the Stockholm Programme and, therefore, the area of freedom, security and justice. I followed both the Tampere process and subsequently, in particular, the Hague process. I regard the Stockholm Programme as absolutely essential and would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency and Prime Minister Reinfeldt on it.
costep_1997-09-15_3_4	Mr President, since our last meeting a statement has been made by Mr Gerhard Schroeder, a German socialist leader, that the Poles are heavily involved in car crime, prostitution is dominated by the Russian mafia, and most drug traffickers come from south east Europe and black Africa. I would like to know what our socialist colleagues on the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs think of that statement, in particular, Mr Ford, Mr Schulz, Mrs Lindeperg, Mrs d'Ancona and indeed Mr Oostlander. I would mention that the comments I referred to were made to a leading German newspaper by Mr Gerhard Schroeder, a candidate in next year’s elections for German Chancellor.
costep_2010-03-24_19_9	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the G20 summit in Pittsburgh provided a good model. It demanded economic recovery plans in order to promote decent work, which will contribute to security and the creation of jobs, and it made the growth of employment a priority. I therefore call on Europe’s labour ministers to press the G20 members, firstly, not to go back on their economic recovery packages, but to work harder and to a greater extent to create jobs; secondly, to work to provide financially secure short-time work to prevent the loss of jobs; thirdly, to promote public investment for the creation of jobs and sustainable ecological growth and, fourthly, to strengthen and extend social security measures to enable access to these measures. That will also safeguard purchasing power within the internal market as well as employment and will help to combat poverty. Cooperation with the social partners is apparently very important to Europe’s labour ministers in order to strengthen the social dialogue to an even greater extent than desired by the Commissioner.
costep_2009-05-07_10_47	You only have to look at the contents of the resolution on the situation in Palestine to see the extent to which it is an unacceptable exercise in hypocrisy and cynicism by a majority in Parliament with regard to human rights (in the world). The resolution does not have a single word of condemnation for Israel’s cruel aggression towards the Palestinian people, which nothing can justify. The resolution whitewashes the savagery inflicted on the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip - which the resolution of the UN Human Rights Council denounced and condemned - and does not have a single word of solidarity for the Palestinian people, who are victims of the most brutal violations of human rights, perpetrated by the Israeli Army and by the terrorism of the Israeli state. The aspects of the resolution with which we may agree cannot override the fact that this annual initiative by the EP is essentially nothing more than a perfidious exercise in the manipulation of human rights and their unacceptable use as a weapon of interference by the EU’s major powers (and their large economic and financial groups) against people who are asserting their sovereignty and rights. Once again we say: you can count on us to defend human rights, but do not count on us for exercises in hypocrisy.
costep_2007-03-12_21_3	Mr President, representatives of the Council and the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, after a mere six months, the Council, the Commission and Parliament have come to an agreement on the revision of the directive on the prudential assessment of acquisitions and increase of shareholdings in the financial sector. It is thanks to the prompt work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and to the purposeful trilogue negotiations that it will be possible to complete this dossier before spring is out, on the assumption that ECOFIN, on 27 March, agrees to it. That is visible evidence to the public that Europe, even with twenty-seven Member States, is capable of taking action and capable of taking important decisions quickly, even - as the Commissioner has just described - with a complex dossier such as this one. It is for that reason that I should like, at the beginning of my speech, to briefly thank all those concerned for their good cooperation, especially the shadow rapporteurs Mr Purvis and Mr Muscat, the chairman of the Committee Mrs Berès, and all those Members who have helped to make it a matter of probability that the directive will, tomorrow, be adopted by all of us, from whatever political grouping, in a block vote. I would also like to highlight the constructive cooperation with the representatives of the Mediterranean states, whom we have been able to convince that their concerns about the fragmented shareholder structure that is so widespread in their countries have been taken into account. Last of all, I extend warm thanks to the Finnish and German Presidencies of the Council and to the Commission, which have competently accompanied our project and ensured smooth cooperation. We need this revised directive. In the past, on more than one occasion, individual enterprises have failed to acquire shareholdings in other countries or to take over whole companies in them, simply for lack of an unambiguous legal framework that would have laid down uniform assessment criteria and hence a uniform procedure for the supervisory authorities. That will now change. The object of the draft directive put forward by the Commission last autumn is greater legal certainty, undoubted reliability and clearly-demarcated decision-making processes, and, since all the interested parties are agreed on these, we have therefore supported it. All three institutions - the Commission, the Council and Parliament - believe that this is the direction in which we must go and that the highest possible degree of harmonisation is needed if people in all the Member States of the European Union are to be able to participate in the market under what really are equal conditions. Nevertheless, there were, inevitably, differences of opinion on one point or another, particularly as regards the test period or what alternative courses of action might be available if the decision turned out to be negative, that is to say if the application for the acquisition of a shareholding or for the takeover of a whole business were to be turned down. It did, however, eventually prove possible, through negotiations, for these problems to be resolved and for us to reach a consensus. In future, then, cross-border mergers of credit institutions, insurance companies and investment firms will be made increasingly easier, and there are four reasons why this is the case. Firstly, the supervisory authorities will, in future, have at most sixty days in which to rule on an increase in a holding. That period will be able to be interrupted only once, and for a period of twenty days, for the purpose of obtaining further information when the potential acquirer is from another EU Member State, or for thirty days if from a third country. Distinguishing in this way between companies from the EU and those from third countries takes account of the fact that the latter’s supervisory and market structures are often not identical with those in the European Union, and that European authorities are therefore not always fully informed about circumstances in those countries. It follows that the supervisory authorities must be allowed more time in which to obtain and evaluate specific information, while the companies from third states also need more time in which to prepare, translate and submit such information. The different suspension periods make both these things possible without breaking WTO rules. Secondly, the five test criteria are unambiguous and final, and they enable the Member States to use them to define the list of specific information that the potential acquirer must submit, which must include the mode of acquisition of the shareholding and the nature of the potential acquirer, so that less information will need to be sought in the event of straightforward and clearly understandable increases in holdings than in the case of those that are more complex and may involve more than one sector. The intention is that, two years following the entry into force of this directive, the Commission will conduct a review to establish whether the requests for information are relatively similar across the Member States or whether a divergence is becoming apparent, and it may well be that the Commission will have to intervene and ensure that no such divergences occur. Thirdly, as the Commissioner has said, the supervisory authorities are required to cooperate closely, although it is specifically laid down that the final decision rests with the authority with jurisdiction over the targeted company, and it is this authority that must also give the reasons for any adverse decision. It is not planned that the publication of those reasons be made mandatory, but the company whose plans for acquisition were thus turned down will be able to demand it. It is equally possible that individual Member States will publish the reasons in accordance with their own laws. Fourthly, the Commission wanted, for the purposes of ascertaining compliance with the directives, to have direct access to the documentation, but that we refused. Our reason for doing so is that the directive will, in future, make for greater legal certainty and clarity. I am firmly persuaded that this will amount to a further step closer to more cross-border consolidations and hence to an increasing integrated internal market.
costep_2011-04-07_7_108	Tunisia, Egypt and Libya were the top news stories at the start of 2011. However, those states are not the only ones with democratic aspirations. Large-scale movements have also emerged in Bahrain, Yemen and Syria. There too, unfortunately, the ruling authorities have responded through the prism of repression and violence. That is unacceptable. A state cannot use violence against its own people and not be penalised by the European Union in the context of its bilateral relations. Through this resolution, the European Union supports the people of Syria in their aspiration to genuinely lift the state of emergency in place since 1963, expresses its solidarity with all of the people in these countries, and calls on the European Union to redefine its relations according to the progress made in reforms.
costep_2011-06-08_5_39	Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, for his excellent work throughout the year, which has received broad political backing. I welcome the message that this report has managed to get across: the solution to the crisis is the assertion of the Union’s status as a global player. The future financial framework mirrors the goals set out in the Europe 2020 strategy and is grounded firmly within the Treaty of Lisbon. However, suitable funding is required for the Union’s priorities to be credible. The development of energy and transport infrastructure, investment in research and development, learning and youth policy must find fresh impetus in the Union’s future budgets, while the fundamental pillars of the cohesion policy and the agricultural policy should continue to receive the current amount of funding. Europe and its big projects clash with budgetary constraints at national level, meaning that greater involvement of the private sector through project bonds or public/private partnerships is the key to raising competitiveness and growth. Together with the rest of the Italian delegation, I am concerned about the proposals to add these so-called 'intermediate categories' to the regional policy, as this risks harming the weakest regions of the Union. I will conclude by asserting that financing the Union entirely through a system based on own resources is the only way to ensure the future and the development of the European Union.
costep_2010-10-07_13_274	The European Social Fund plays a vital role in social cohesion by helping to integrate workers in Europe’s regions. Its action in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises, education and vocational training is essential to the success of the EU 2020 strategy. The European Social Fund’s role could, however, be strengthened further. The future architecture of the Structural Funds for 2014-2020 will have to take into account the specific characteristics of that fund. Some adjustments could be envisaged. However, it is important to keep the European Social Fund within the framework of the general regulations on the Structural Funds, as is the case today. To grant it its own legal framework will inevitably have the effect of fragmenting European policies and creating pointless complications for the beneficiaries. European policy coherence must go hand in hand with an integrated vision of objectives and resources, which requires greater synergy between instruments. The European Social Fund should therefore continue to come under the regulation on general provisions concerning the funds, with its own rules, certainly, but under no circumstances with its own budget.
costep_2011-03-09_11_104	Today, the Atlantic is one of Europe’s borders and has been one of the European continent’s most important means of contact with the world. It was across this ocean that European peoples, particularly the Portuguese, came into contact with peoples, economies and cultures previously unknown to one another, and forged what is today a truly globalised world. Today, the Atlantic region suffers marginalisation compared with Europe’s centre, and this can and must be remedied through the understanding that the Atlantic and relationships with the more important partners bordering it, such as Brazil and the United States, can bring about the reaffirmation of a geostrategic centrality that has, however, been displaced by the emergence of the Asian countries. The importance of the region fully justifies the establishment of a European strategy which, true to the role historically reserved for the ocean that gives it its name, does not confine itself to the Member States, but rather is able to provide a link to those other coasts. In this regard, I would stress the extremely important and irreplaceable role of the outermost regions in the strategy’s success. These continue to merit special support from the Union, which can overcome the costs of insularity and boost foreign contacts.
costep_1999-07-23_1_2	Madam President, today’s Minutes include an Annex indicating that the Bureaux of delegations of the joint parliamentary committees for Associated States have already been elected. However, if you read the Rules of Procedure, you will see that Rule 170(6) states that the appointment of the joint parliamentary committees is somewhat different from the interparliamentary delegations and must therefore be carried out under the same conditions as the appointment of the committees. This is how we have done it in the past. This means that elections must take place as for the committees. The fact that there are discussions between the groups of parties is another matter altogether. So, in the case of interparliamentary delegations, the Plenum decides, whereas in the case of the joint parliamentary committees for Associated States, in my opinion, Rule 170(6) applies. I would like to make that point. There is a second point which I would also like to make. The deadline for submitting the relevant proposals was ten o'clock yesterday. However, the proposals - that is, the preliminary draft - on which we voted did not reach us until after ten o'clock and so I must call the entire vote into question. I would ask you to consider both points and give me your feedback at the next sitting.
costep_2002-09-03_2_79	Today it is widely recognised that cabin crews bear a huge responsibility and are of increasing importance to passenger safety, given the current climate in civil aviation. It is crucial that we harmonise flight times, working hours and rest requirements for cabin staff, not only in view of future enlargement but also, and especially, because we feel that there is an urgent need to protect these workers in light of the expansion of low cost airlines in the European Union. This is why we support this report, which seeks to remedy a shortcoming on the part of the Commission in not including this matter in its proposal for a Regulation, which we can only deplore, all the more because various Members States still have no legislation on this matter. Nevertheless, we wish to stress the importance of maintaining existing national legislation that is more favourable to workers than the proposal that has now been approved.
costep_2002-03-12_2_301	Mr President, the recommendations under discussion today put forward by my colleague, Mrs Paulsen, are a continuation of the important work she has been so very commendably involved in as Parliament’s rapporteur regarding updating the legislation on food safety. We have been able to respond to food crises in the current parliamentary term in a way that has been both consistent and wide-ranging. Our common goal is to restore complete consumer confidence and levels of safety. I would like to say that I agree with the view expressed just now by Mr Pesälä regarding Amendment No 15. The traditional, common sense way in which catering waste is used for feeding has for the present unfortunately proved problematic as a result of inadequacies in the processing of feed. Serious animal diseases have thus been able to spread. For that reason Parliament now requires the Commission to promptly submit a legislative proposal banning the use of catering waste of animal origin as feed and obliging Member States to provide proof of its safe disposal. As an exception, the production of feed from catering waste could be permitted if it has been properly sterilised in an officially authorised plant. Parliament can also feel pleased with how the codecision procedure works and the cooperation established with the Council in the area of food safety. That is why it is unfortunate that the most prominent element in publicising the work to improve food safety, the establishment of a new Food Safety Authority, has proved such a difficult task in the Council and that the agency is commencing its work in a temporary location. This is also likely to hamper the recruitment of qualified staff for the agency. In this respect the Council should be capable of making the right decisions swiftly and showing consumers that the long-term work done to guarantee the supply of safe food is more important that seeking to obtain short-term benefits for individual countries in the Council.
costep_2010-06-15_8_107	It is with enthusiasm that I voted in favour of this text. It represents a major step forward for freight and transport in Europe, which will now be more competitive and less expensive. Europe is moving towards greater interconnection between European rail networks, freight corridors and sea and river ports. This is an important step in the sustainable development of the rail transport sector in Europe, which will thus be able, at long last, to offer a real alternative to air and road transport. Henceforth, international corridors linking the Member States will be managed by cross-border authorities which coordinate infrastructure management and slot allocation. This will all be topped by a one-stop shop for each rail corridor, the creation of which I actively defended. This innovation allows Europe to move forward and characterises its will to achieve better cooperation and greater integration in the transport sector. I welcome the adoption of this report, which strengthens the bases of the large European rail freight network which I have been calling for for several years.
costep_2000-07-06_10_6	Madam President, first of all I would like to express my gratitude to Mr Van Hecke and his wife Els De Temmerman for their efforts in ensuring that the child soldiers issue in Northern Uganda, and anything related to this, is published in an unambiguous manner for the benefit of Europe. What is clear is that despite the 1999 Nairobi Agreement, it has not been possible to apply this agreement in an adequate manner. This brings us to the question of the EU’s authority and the willingness on the part of the Member States to act as a united front in that region. I would ask Commissioner Verheugen specifically whether he is absolutely clear about the point mentioned in the resolution, that of bringing the investments in both oil and oil pipelines in Sudan to a halt for the time being. If we exert pressure to bring about peace and make sure we gain control in that northern region, this could lead to very concrete steps within a foreign policy which combines the aid component, the foreign component and the trade component. Such action is a matter of great priority. At the moment, we only see these figures and examples increase, and at the same time, we notice that we are exerting too little pressure, although we have more clout there than we have made use of to date. This brings me to the wider issue of the United Nations. The protocol was accepted in the General Assembly in May. In July, a debate will be held in the Security Council. This would, of course, be a wonderful example of a Europe which does not only hold forth internally, but also takes steps externally. We, all the European Member States together, are very much in favour of the eighteen years, swift conclusion by signature and effective, coordinated action by the different countries where matters such as education and the re-integration of child soldiers are concerned. We do a great deal financially in this respect in different countries. We have a good reputation there. It would be beneficial if we could act under one banner and with one voice. I would be interested to find out from Commissioner Verheugen how he rates our chance of success in July.
costep_2001-09-03_6_2	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the idea of creating a European form of company obeying the same supranational rules in all Member States is almost as old as the European Union itself. The Societas Europaea (SE) is the flagship of European company law. The academic foundations were laid in the late 1950s. In 1970, the Commission submitted a proposal for a regulation on the statute of an SE. It contained uniform law down to the last detail. In 1989, the Commission submitted an entirely new proposal for a regulation which excluded social and labour law, fiscal law, law on competition, protection of industrial property rights, insolvency law and industrial constitution law. Finally in Nice, political agreement was reached on a Council regulation on the statute and on a directive on worker participation. As regards the legal base: the 1989 proposal was based on the present Article 95 which establishes the right of co-decision. The Nice proposals are based on Article 308 whereby Parliament would simply be consulted. Article 95 is just as appropriate a legal base for the regulation as Article 308. For the purposes of democratic legitimacy - and in line with decisions of the Court of Justice - the legal base giving Parliament most say should be chosen in such a case. Consequently, Parliament reserves the right, following adoption by the Council, to bring a case before the Court to examine the legal base. As regards the regulation: pursuant to Articles 2 and 3, there are different ways in which an SE can be established. The capital of the SE must be at least EUR 120 000. There are two different systems of managing limited liability companies under the company law of the Member States. The 'single' system in Britain, for example, provides solely for an administrative body. The 'dual' system, applicable in Germany, for example, provides for a supervisory body and a management body. European unification now requires that both systems be available in each country so that it is possible to choose freely between them. Hitherto, company law of the Member States has been such that national companies can only transfer their place of business if they are dissolved and re-formed in another Member State. With an SE, a transfer will not result in the company being dissolved or in a new legal entity being created. The growing together of what used to be separate markets means that we must finally create organisational forms which reflect the new situation in Europe. However, there are serious shortcomings in the structure of the SEs. SEs will differ from one Member State to another. There will not be one European SE, but an SE with French, Spanish or German features, for example. Furthermore, even within the same Member State a variety of different SEs will be created to cover various company features such as co-decision making. I consider it essential that, parallel to the entry into force of the regulation, accompanying fiscal rules should also be adopted. The precise nature of the SE will, naturally, be determined in part by fiscal legislation. To this end, the series of amendments from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is to be welcomed. In conclusion, I advocate launching the SE on its maiden voyage. This will show where repairs are still needed so that one day it will fulfil our hopes and become the flagship.
costep_2009-03-26_8_6	Madam President, regions are an extremely important place for the development of culture. It is there that most long-lasting exchange programmes and joint projects between areas of different traditions, customs and achievements arise. Regions stimulate the development of culture, and culture - important, attractive projects and events - becomes a magnet which attracts economic investment. This is the classic knock-on effect, which is best illustrated by the effects of the splendid European Capital of Culture programme. Economic revival always follows the year of cultural events. This is understood by the numerous European cities trying to take part in the project. Culture is a great opportunity, especially for areas which are underdeveloped but rich in natural resources or tourist and recreation attractions due to their geographical location. Therefore it is particularly important to be aware of the significant role of regional authorities and to stimulate their activity by special European Union programmes. I expect the Commission to submit a green paper shortly, presenting a broad concept of measures in the area of culture, including the key matter of the level of regions. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me finally to draw attention to the initiative to establish the year 2013 as European Year of Learning the Languages of our Neighbours. Dynamic development of regional cooperation in Europe is often hampered by problems related to a lack of knowledge of the language and culture of neighbouring countries and regions, and a lack of ability to communicate fully. Learning the language of an immediate neighbour can be a great leap forward for mutual understanding and communication, and therefore for strengthening cultural and economic cooperation and consolidating the entire European Community.
costep_2010-04-21_5_20	Mr President, thank you, Commissioner Malmström. The negotiating mandate before us shows, above all, that the Commission and Parliament are again taking the same line and that cooperation has at least got off to a good start. The fact that the European Parliament rejected the agreement in February - and I address this to all those who have described it as muscle flexing - has nothing to do with muscle flexing; it is about assuming responsibility. Assuming responsibility for the rights of those that we represent, namely the citizens of Europe. The negotiations on the new agreement on the transfer of bank data now under way will, above all, answer the crucial question as to where Parliament and the European Union stand on respect. Respect among partners, respect for citizens and respect for European legislation. We were able to slip a lot of things that are important to us into this negotiating mandate. The resolution that we will adopt in May very much reflects those things that specifically concern the protection of our citizens, both their data and their judicial remedies, including extraterritorial protection, particularly when their rights could be violated extraterritorially. We have talked a lot about the transfer of aggregated data, so-called bulk data transfers. What we must clarify is the fact that in the mandate concluded, we must set out how and when this problem will be resolved. Otherwise, it will be very difficult to represent the whole thing in light of what we have formulated so far. The European Parliament’s resolution highlights this in two paragraphs, the negotiating mandate in one. I am confident that the Commission will resolve this in a sensible manner.
costep_1997-11-20_3_12	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I do not think there is a single lunatic in Europe who can say that the Mafia does not exist. The Mafia does exist! It is very powerful and very well organized; it is now an international and transnational phenomenon that uses far more effective means than the obsolete means of our small Member States of the European Union, and I would also say outside the European Union. Today, organized crime, a great threat to the lawful state, is a great threat to democracy in many countries; it is attacking the economic and production nerve centres of many countries and attacking many young democracies, by money laundering, by international trafficking in drugs, arms and anything else. All this is now obvious, no-one can deny it. So it is absolutely essential to have a European judicial network, a stronger connection, more coordination between those involved in preventing and suppressing this phenomenon. Having said that, however, we cannot forget that, behind the legitimate requirement for more effective means, a temptation could be hiding for, after infecting Europe with unfavourable forms, such as organized crime, as Mr Orlando said, Europe could be infected with other viruses, legal substantialism, that of legal short cuts comprising exceptional laws, suspensions and compression of the right to the protection of individual rights. We are asked for a balance. We too want a balance, with the full individual guarantee of rights of defence, such as the direct relationship between criminal fact and accused, something that some are beginning to deny. We believe it necessary for criminals to be convicted with objective controls and not just through information on changes in living conditions that are particularly advantageous. We do not regard this as a balance; otherwise, the fight against crime would be counterproductive: the remedy would be worse than the evil, because it would affect citizens who are defenceless against the excessive power of the state and we would leave the real criminals unpunished.
costep_2011-03-23_17_21	Madam President, I would, first of all, like to congratulate Mr Oettinger on getting off to a good start. You did, indeed, get off to a flying start last week, but since then you seem to have gone downhill. However, you really need to tackle this now and clarify your position, because what you said last week was that we should have a debate on Europe and on a future for Europe without nuclear energy. You have not repeated that since then, although that should be the subject of our debate now. Time and again, many studies, scientific studies, have shown that you can achieve your environmental targets without using nuclear energy. It is possible to run Europe entirely on sustainable power. That should be the subject of our debate today. Being for or against nuclear energy is a matter of political choice. We should not have to justify why we are against nuclear energy. Those who are in favour of nuclear energy are the ones who should come up with a justification. Hence, the importance of the stress test. I have two questions for you, Mr Oettinger, two important questions. First of all: how are we going to establish the criteria? How are we going to ensure they are independent? Secondly, what will happen if a nuclear power fails to pass the stress test? What will be the consequences then?
costep_2001-11-29_1_24	Mr President, bioethics, or the ethics of the living being, forces us to face certain basic questions, and it is an honour for this House that we should be discussing them today. What is our conception of the human being? Is it a utilitarian or scientific conception, in which human beings, and, in particular, the weakest human beings, are placed in the service of science, or is it a humanist conception, which places science in the service of human beings? What constitutes the dignity of the human being? Are we to accept the view that dignity may vary according to age, ability, health, or the manner in which an embryo is created? No, at a time when laboratories are challenging the consciences of the whole world, I would like Parliament to insist that we all have the same dignity and the same humanity. What is the point of scientific research? Are we going to allow research to become the mirage of a new financial Eldorado? No, research must retain the nobility of its purpose - to be at the service of human beings, and in particular to relieve suffering, to assist and care for the disabled, and to improve living conditions for everyone, including those in developing countries. There must be no contradiction between the dignity of the embryo and that of the sick person. Our position must therefore be consistent and well founded. We must not be subject to the whims of the moment, but must base our position on respect for the dignity of the human being, which is the only guarantee of scientific progress.
costep_2007-11-29_8_40	While attempting to impose the essence of a treaty proposal that has already been rejected, variously called 'constitutional', 'mini', 'simplified' and 'reforming', the EU’s supranational institutions are continuing to promote the artificial creation of a so-called 'European public opinion.' Moreover, we recall, this determination became something like a crusade after the French and Dutch rejected the 'European Constitution', and it has resorted to every available means, including the 'European political parties' and now their political grass roots, to promote the 'formation of a European conscience.' As the Portuguese Presidency has said, the involvement of 'all our citizens in this fascinating process of European construction' is the 'real substance', the 'real cause', the 'real issue.' We should therefore ask why, despite so much enthusiasm, the holding of referendums on the European Treaty is being avoided. However, this is not what the dominant forces in the EU want. What they now want, among other things, is Community budget funding to finance the European Parliament election campaigns of the European political parties, which could constitute clear interference in the internal political affairs and democratic functioning of each country.
costep_2001-05-30_5_35	Mr President, we support this resolution reaffirming the full right of the European Parliament to take part in decisions on the future of the Union, which many government ministers still believe to be their exclusive prerogative. To obtain that right, we call on the Commission, the national parliaments and those governments which recognise that genuine democracy at European level is in the interests of their citizens - perhaps not in the interest of their administrations, but certainly in the interests of their citizens. Those are the governments which no longer believe the nonsense about the mystical omnipotence of the sovereign state and which were embarrassed at Nice by the haggling that went on there. We want them to become our allies in obtaining two things: a constitution and a convention. We expect their support on these two matters.
costep_2002-04-09_2_33	Mr President, the enormous budget surplus in 2000 to the tune of EUR 11.6 billion illustrates that budgetary management still leaves something to be desired. In the Structural Funds, under spending is even starting to have structural implications. In our view, unspent amounts should be returned to the Member States, at least after two years. This could help these Member States reduce their national debt, for example. We therefore support Amendment No 9 tabled by Mr Heaton-Harris. The management of the Structural Funds requires substantial improvement. The complex Community regulations must be simplified. Coordination between the Commission and the Member States is well below par. Financial inspection is riddled with loopholes, both ex-ante and ex-post. The current financial correction system must also be changed as a matter of urgency, because it encourages Member States to cover up irregularities and fraud instead of reporting dirty tricks. We have known this for years, but the Commission and the Member States are still doing much too little to improve the situation. We are disappointed that the pre-accession aid programmes are not achieving their objectives by a long chalk. The findings in the special report drawn up by the Court of Auditors are disturbing. The fact that it is unlikely that the candidate countries will be able to implement the various aid programmes during this calendar year is unacceptable to us. I would ask the Commission to inform us of the present state of affairs. The reform of the European Commission which was initiated in 1999 is still not evident in terms of specific results in 2000. I trust that the Commissioner will now have some insight into the results achieved over the course of 2001. We would be interested to find out whether she would be prepared to share some of the information. There is also considerable under spending in aid programmes for development cooperation. Duplication with Member States' policies may be partly to blame for this. Would the Commission map this out for us soon? In our view, the subsidiarity principle should be taken seriously in EU development policy. Finally, I have made the shocking discovery that each part-session in Strasbourg costs approximately EUR 11.5 million extra per week, quite apart from the environmental pollution they cause. This Parliament is forced into this situation solely in order to honour the wish of one Member State. It would therefore be fair if this Member State were to reimburse this House to the amount of the total estimated annual additional costs of EUR 138 million.
costep_2000-07-03_6_17	Mr President, by having two summits in succession, one in Lisbon and one in Feira, Portugal has endeavoured to make its presidency a success. When it comes to taking stock, I am bound to say that although there has been a great deal of rumination over the past few months, all this brainwork has produced little in the way of tangible results. First and foremost, I would cite the postponement of the decision on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Its status was originally to be clarified during the Portuguese presidency, but nothing came of it. No doubt a decision will be rushed through during the French presidency. This will make it impossible for sound democratic control to be exercised. The decision making in the field of the CESDP also demonstrates the lack of unanimity amongst the Member States. It may be true that a number of interim committees have been set up and it has been determined how often negotiations should be undertaken with third countries, but the objective of the whole operation is still vague to this day. It will not be established until the Member States make known, during the capabilities conference this coming autumn, what it is they actually want to contribute to this risky European project. A strange order in which to do things. As a rule, we think about objectives and requirements before we look for the ways and means. The ambiguity of Europe’s intentions is even more apparent in Annex 2 to the presidency’s conclusions on relations between the European Union and NATO. It says on the one hand that the autonomy of Community decision making must be taken into account, yet at the same time, the spirit of the EU-NATO partnership is lauded to the skies. In short, after all these years, Europe still does not know what it wants. Therefore, as far as I can see, there is also little point in extending the Union with all manner of interesting institutions. The Portuguese Presidency has shown yet again that it is high time the tasks and competences of Europe and the national Member States were given clear definition.
costep_2010-10-21_8_94	The European standardisation system has been fundamental in achieving a single market. It has played a key role in responding to the growing need in European legislation and policy for standards that are capable of ensuring product safety, ease of access, innovation, interoperability, and environmental protection. In order to address the future needs of companies and consumers and to yield all its potential benefits in favour of public and social objectives, European standardisation must adapt to the challenges posed by globalisation, climate change, the emergence of new economic powers and technological evolution. It is therefore necessary to develop a strategic approach to European standardisation, and to review the current system so that it can continue to be successful and respond to the needs of the next decade, allowing Europe to maintain its leading role in the global standardisation system.
costep_1999-02-24_5_16	Madam President, Mr Swoboda has just reproached the Council communiqué for not including the word 'Kurds'. Let me quote a Turkish newspaper, the Turkish paper Radical which praised this text as being 'rédigé avec finesse et précaution ' - carefully and delicately worded. So in other words it is an exceptionally hypocritical text. I agree with the Council that the problems in Turkey must be solved by political means. I welcome the Council’s statement that ' all genuine efforts to separate the fight against terrorism from the search for political solutions ' must be made, but my problem is that the Council does not say that efforts of that kind are conspicuous by their absence at the moment in Turkey. Mention was made of the HADEP trial before a state security court, a trial which significantly is being held before the elections, to be concluded after the elections, so that voters know that they risk voting for the wrong party if it has just been banned. The number of intellectuals sentenced or still before the state security courts for doing precisely what the Council wants to see happening in Turkey is alarmingly high. There is not a word about this in the whole of the Council document. That is what I regret most. A word or two on what Commissioner van den Broek said just now about aid to south-eastern Turkey. I agree with him. But I think it has so far been extremely difficult to give aid to an area where two parties are engaged in military confrontation. Aid is then always aid to one side which gets used against the other. The situation at the moment is somewhat clearer, in that the PKK really has been pushed back quite a bit by the army, so that rather more can be done in the region. But the Commissioner might also have said that the European Union, with Parliament’s backing, is currently addressing this, and that we have initiated some fairly sizeable health and vocational training projects aimed at that region. The problem remains, though, that the Turks have still not signed the cooperation agreement and therefore cannot currently accept this aid because the financial basis is not yet there, and that is their fault. One more small point. I think it is essential for the Commission to support the NGOs in Turkey in order to bring about the civil society, the democracy and the human rights we need there. I think it is quite dreadful that the Commission, by insisting that the NGOs provide financial guarantees, sums which they do not have, has currently brought these kinds of programmes to a complete halt. Urgent action needs to be taken on that, and very soon.
costep_2010-12-16_7_101	Important decisions were taken this year aiming to establish an EU framework for economic governance and financial supervision. The EU will see the launch of the European Systemic Risk Board, responsible for the macro-prudential oversight of the financial system in order to avoid periods of widespread financial distress and contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market, thereby ensuring a sustainable contribution on the part of the financial sector to economic growth. I approve of the proposal to establish a permanent European Stability Mechanism and so further reinforce economic governance, in order to be able to ensure effective and rigorous economic surveillance and coordination, which will focus on prevention. I agree with the proposal set out in the resolution that Member States outside the euro area should have the possibility to be involved in the creation of this mechanism and they should be given the opportunity to obtain financial assistance if necessary.
costep_2011-02-14_18_16	We have heard from Commissioner Dalli the very cautious position of the European Commission regarding research on stem cells from cord blood. This is hardly surprising. The Commission proposed and pushed through in the Seventh Framework Programme an enormous package of support for contentious stem cell research and is afraid to admit that this research failed to fulfil expectations. Moreover, it is now clear that the research on stem cells obtained from the bodies of unborn children did not produce anything like the results from research on cells obtained from cord blood. Until recently, this blood was regarded as biological waste. In light of the latest reports of successful experiments and even treatments using stem cells from cord blood, how can the Commission defend the morally unacceptable production of human embryos for research purposes? Also, why has Commissioner Dalli not presented us today with a concrete plan for the Commission to increase the percentage of cord blood collected at birth, instead of a meaningless opinion? I hope it is because his staff are still hard at work on such a plan. I assume that the Commission will propose a mechanism in the plan which will relieve parents of the burden of paying for the collection and subsequent storage of cord blood. I also expect that the plan will include a reassessment of priorities in the area of stem cell research.
costep_1997-09-15_10_16	Mr President, may I begin by congratulating our colleague Mr Van Dam on his maiden speech: it was intelligent and clear, the kind of speech we used to hear from his predecessor. I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Brian Simpson, on the common position of the Council. I know of few cases where the Council has so greatly departed from a Commission proposal in order extensively to meet the views of the rapporteur and the majority of the Parliament. In this situation, I feel it is important for the directive to be accepted as quickly as possible. I would ask my colleagues again to reflect carefully before we accept amendments that will lead to the conciliation procedure and therefore to further delay. The postal services and companies may also request that the politicians finally provide some clarity, so that they can develop a policy for the future, in which of course the interests of the consumers must be central. I should like to hear from the Commissioner whether I am right that if Amendments Nos 7 to 12 in particular are accepted, they will very probably mean further delay. The present directive is an extremely small step on the way to an internal market for the post in which there is room for a modest market operation in the interests of the consumer. To hollow out this directive even further as some of the amendments aim for, is not good for the consumer and is also not good for jobs in the medium term. Technological developments occur quickly. I should very much like a pledge from the Commissioner that at the end of next year he will come up with a realistic programme for the real liberalization of the market in the interests of the consumer and jobs.
costep_2010-12-15_18_9	Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the elections in Côte d'Ivoire have just taken place. The international community tolerated their being postponed year after year by the regime of Laurent Gbagbo. These successive reports alerted a number of us to the difficulties in which we find ourselves at the moment but, deep within ourselves, we hoped that the democratic spirit would prevail in a country that has suffered a great deal from sterile and unacceptable confrontations focused, in particular, around the concept of Ivorian nationality. The international community and, in particular, the European Union around Baroness Ashton and through my fellow Member, Mr Preda, mobilized to ensure that these elections took place under the best possible conditions, transparently and without violence. This should be commended. In view of the calm that prevailed and the atmosphere of mutual respect among candidates, the electoral campaign gave us cause to hope that the result would be accepted by all the parties. Today, unfortunately, the democratic result that emerged through the ballot box has been rejected by the outgoing President. Tomorrow, like my fellow Members, I will therefore vote in favour of appealing to Mr Gbagbo to accept that what appears to him to be a reversal of fortune or a conspiracy is, in fact, simply the will of the majority of his citizens. He cannot hang on to power without calling into question part of his own militant history, which was to appear, when resident in Europe, as the man who had brought about the newly regained freedom and democracy established in his country. The United Nations representative in Côte d'Ivoire courageously assumed his role and announced the results of the ballot. As First Vice-President of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I would also like to point out that a declaration was adopted by our Assembly on 3 December in Kinshasa firmly condemning the decision of the Ivorian Constitutional Council for invalidating the results. This declaration comes on top of the clear and unambiguous position taken by the leaders of the Member States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and of the African Union. Today, the regime of Mr Gbagbo is neither wanted by its citizens, nor supported by its neighbours, nor accepted by the international community. It is therefore time that he accepted the victory of Alassane Ouattara, the democratically elected President of Côte d'Ivoire, who must be in a position to take on the responsibility entrusted to him by his people as soon as possible. Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude by asking the European Union to assume its role through the means at its disposal to persuade Laurent Gbagbo and his illegitimate government to accept that the game is over. We will not allow his obstinacy to lead to chaos in Côte d'Ivoire.
costep_2001-05-17_1_15	Madam President, on item 25 of the Minutes and on the excellent motion of inadmissibility by Mr Ribeiro e Castro which was adopted yesterday, I would like to point out that the Minutes mention the speeches by Mr Poettering, asking for the report to be included in the agenda for the next part-session, Mr Barón Crespo, asking for it to be added to the agenda of the next day’s sitting, and Mr Berthu, who replied, but whose position is not stated. For accuracy of the Minutes, I would like to make it clear that, in any case, the motion of inadmissibility was adopted, the report cannot be put back on the agenda and, were it to be, that would not be possible without another meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. It would not be proper to proceed otherwise.
costep_1998-07-02_2_2	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Social Charter was adopted at the Strasbourg Summit of December 1989 and was seen at the time by many as a great step forwards. I had my doubts and I remember very well a discussion I had prior to the Summit with a member of the COREPER who tried to bring me to an understanding of the far-reaching consequences of the text to be adopted in 1989. My lack of understanding at the time was caused by the fact that I come from a country where the rights of employee and employer organisations are well established and so my feeling was that the European Charter would not add anything new. Now we are ten years on and - the report is the best proof of this - I must say that the Social Charter of that time is not yet firmly anchored in the EC Treaty. We have now had two Treaty amendments, Maastricht and Amsterdam. The Social Protocol is indeed well established, but the limitations that were formulated with regard to pay, the right of association and the right to strike or the right of lock-out have unfortunately not been adopted. Our European social policy is thus to my mind still not mature. With regard to the initial report itself, the history, I am keen to establish for the benefit of historians that the long period needed to get this report to the House cannot be blamed on any unwillingness on the part of the rapporteur or her political party. Let it be known that the christian democrats were standard bearers of the socially-orientated market economy and I know from experience that allowing social partners responsibilities leads to a successful society. I am also keen to mention that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs' decision to write a report was based on many petitions, namely from the United Kingdom because trade union rights were not settled there and the idea was that if we now have something at European level then it will happen here as well. Thirdly, because I must also persuade the free marketeers, it is too crazy for words that Europe has repeatedly pressed for the freedom to form trade unions and the freedom to negotiate to be adopted in international or global agreements, for example within the framework of the WTO, while we have not adopted these guarantees in our own EC Treaty. The matter that we have to sort out is trade union rights as such. What I would like is for the European Commission to come forward with an initiative, I am not asking for a directive, a proposal, but rather an initiative for specific research. The group of experts that is at present already analysing the Treaty of Amsterdam, looking at what the shortcomings are, could very well report on this point. I ask also that the social partners make a first move, because it concerns them. They must ensure, and the annual report from the reports by the group of experts is possibly a good starting point, that a proposal is provided. In connection with trade union rights I have also made a number of remarks about the social dialogue and also the rules of that game. I am sometimes concerned as to whether there is sufficient room for this social dialogue. I am well aware that for some Member States we cannot settle very awkward matters from one day to the next. All the same, I think that in a mature society where it is observed that there are still too few rights, the social and political organizations should be able to tackle the problem quickly. I thank all those who have contributed to the creation of this report.
costep_2009-11-12_11_25	I welcome the European Union’s efforts to strengthen its relations with Russia, thus contributing to greater stability, security and prosperity for Europe. One of the most crucial areas of cooperation in EU-Russia relations is specifically that of energy and energy security. It is essential to create the stability needed to guarantee the security of supplies to EU Member States and their consumers. I hope the energy dialogue and the commitments resulting from the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit will, in the long term, lead to greater transparency and viability for the energy sector, and that this sector, in turn, can help to establish new structural relations between the two blocs through the development of commercial and economic cooperation. Equally important is cooperation between the EU and Russia on climate change, so as to secure a global agreement at the Copenhagen conference. I would emphasise the strategic nature of EU-Russia relations and their contribution to the process of mutual understanding and trust, which is essential for establishing peace and stability across the continent of Europe.
costep_2005-10-13_1_39	Madam President, we endorse the report’s fundamental objective and welcome the intention that changes be made to definitions and various technical provisions. Debates on proposals from the Commission that might lead, in the long or short term, to restrictions being placed on fishing activity, are always heated, and that on this proposal has been no exception. It might not be evident from the outcome of the vote in Committee, but there were a number of points on which a compromise could be reached only after in-depth discussions. With this in mind, I would like especially to draw attention to Article 12 of the Commission proposal, which deals with restrictions on, and the prohibition of, driftnets. Our group has previously endorsed all attempts to provide for a reduction in the use of these devices or a ban on them, and so it necessarily follows that the same strict rules should apply in the Baltic as in other European Union fishing grounds, in which driftnets have for years been banned in order to give small cetaceans a better chance of survival. Certain efforts are being made to jeopardise the current ban on driftnets, and these our group repudiates. Day-to-day practice shows, however, that a valid legal framework will only be any good in so far as it is capable of being monitored, simply and effectively, on the ground, in other words, in practice. This, I think, is where the main difficulties lie, and I hope that this legal framework will result in a more vigorous approach to monitoring in future.
costep_2010-10-20_7_34	Mr Rangel is proposing very important amendments to the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament. It is possible that, directly as a result of these adjustments to the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, the problems that we debate will be resolved more quickly. I should especially like to see that the decisions and recommendations of the European Parliament are carried out in EU Member States. Only when we put our own house in order will the EU’s recommendations to third countries carry considerably more weight. For example, the recommendations in the European Parliament resolution of 11 March 2004 on the situation of non-citizens in Latvia have still not been implemented. I hope that the revised Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament will help EU institutions to form a clear picture of the violations of basic human rights taking place in Latvia.
costep_1997-09-17_3_17	Mr President, missio pacis, mission of peace. The bible of the old church used this translation for the name of Jerusalem. Is it possible to maintain this name in view of the barbaric terror used by the enemies of peace? Not only must it be maintained, but it can be, because this city, the city of Yad Vashem and of the Grove of the Righteous of All Nations, is a symbol of the vulnerability of terrorism. Terrorism can be vanquished, but only by one method: by the unshakeableness of the conviction that there is no alternative to peace and the peace process. For this reason I should like here - and I am aware of the bias of my vote - in the name of my parliamentary party to call upon Prime Minister Netanyahu and his Government to fulfill the Oslo agreements to the letter, comprehensively and in the spirit of the peace process. Because, whereas security is the central point of his policy, it is also clear that security for the Israeli people can only be achieved in this one way, begun in Washington and Oslo.
costep_2007-06-18_18_16	Madam President, our further discussion of the importation of the skins of two million slaughtered Chinese dogs and cats is comparable to that which we had in the 1990s, when we returned on three occasions to discussing the importation from the Arctic regions of the furs of animals killed in leghold traps. On each occasion, whether we were talking about seals, dogs, cats or foxes, I am sorry to have to say that the Commission played for time and allowed the trade to continue to the greater glory of the Market Almighty. Let us never forget that, in March 1996, despite proof that mad cow disease was capable of being transmitted to humans, the Commission threatened four German Länder with sanctions for their refusal to allow the importation of suspect cattle. The lesson one can learn from all that is that the logic of the market demands that everything be capable of being bought or sold or used as a means to making a profit, whether it be dogs, cats, kidneys, eyes, women, children, slaves, or workers. That is why the economy must be subject to political constraints, in order that those great values that are beyond price may be re-established.
costep_1997-07-15_3_26	Mr President, we had a great battle with Mr Langer in 1995 to defeat this directive. At the time, Mr Langer was staunch in his defence of plants and animals while I was for the embryo and therefore human beings. Combining those two elements, human beings and plants and animals caused a great deal of confusion in people’s minds and caused much time to be lost. Had they been kept separate, we should long since have entered into competition with the United States and Japan, and we need that for development in Europe and to create jobs. The Rothley report is today being submitted to us once again. I think that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has done a great job. I personally approve of what they have done. I call for Article 9 in particular to be kept as it is and invite the House to adopt it as it stands, without changing anything.
costep_1998-04-01_4_13	Mr President, allow me to deal particularly with the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in this debate. In this agreement, there is already an effective instrument for carrying on a permanent dialogue with our Russian partners about all those questions of a political and economic nature which are central to our mutual relationship. Let us not forget that it was the parliaments - the European Parliament and the Russian State Duma - which christened the first of the executive bodies of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee which I chair with my Russian colleague, Mr Ryshkov. In this capacity I would like to emphasize particularly how profitable the work in this committee was last December. I can assure you that we address the individual problems in the relationship between the EU and Russia very openly with our Russian colleagues, and that we are frank about the difficulties. Continuity of contacts and regular mutual visits, which create mutual trust, are particularly important, even if the contacts on the Russian side are continually changing. I think that it is not too much to say that the form of cooperation which we are developing is a future model for Russian-European cooperation. In this way, the relationship with our Russian partners can be constructed and can be further extended without discussing Russia’s EU membership. Neither side needs to discuss that. In this context, allow me to point out the importance of the TACIS programme. In her report, Mrs Lalumière calls on the Commission to strengthen support for these projects, and demands that the priorities in TACIS aid for the improvement of daily living conditions should start with setting up the structures necessary for the rule of law. I would like to underline this very explicitly. We know that we must improve this TACIS programme, but we also know that preparatory work is essential for our future cooperation between Russia and the European Union.
costep_2007-09-05_2_28	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this debate is enabling us, in the meantime, to overcome, to take stock, but also to overcome some dangerous mistakes - a first mistake. We are debating a strategy against terrorism, not against Islam, and reducing the causes of terrorism in a simplistic way to Islamic fundamentalism would be a rather superficial solution, a rather simplistic reading. Similarly, some turns of phrase that I have just heard worry me: the mosques bring war into our societies! These are rather general, rather violent, and rather boorish opinions. Imagine if in Turkey tomorrow an MP stood up in the Turkish Parliament and said 'the Christian churches bring war into our society' - what would be the indignant reaction of this Parliament? I would also like to make a suggestion to Mr Frattini: we know that enforcement work is absolutely fundamental, just as much as preventive work. I believe, however, that calculations ought to be made on the basis not of alleged terrorists arrested but on actual terrorists found guilty. It would be useful to monitor or do some reconnaissance work on how many terrorist suspects have been arrested over recent years in our countries and have subsequently been released. We have received some replies from the Council, but some of these have been partial answers. I would like to focus on three points here that we need to explore more deeply: it is not very clear to us what the role of this Parliament ought to be, and how it is to be truly associated with this European Union strategy. We do not believe - and this has been pointed out by other Members - that a meeting once every six months between the Vice-President and the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Council is sufficient. We believe that a quality and level of consensus is required that cannot be limited to these formal, ritualistic meetings. It is not clear to us what will happen regarding the functions of the EU counter-terrorism coordinator. It has been explained to us that this function is primarily linked to providing strategic assessments and disseminating information. When our committee had the opportunity of talking with Mr de Vries, it was admitted to us that the function was completely devoid of content or tools. In that case, I believe that nothing can be more damaging than an institutional function that does not have the tools with which to exist or give an account of itself. Finally, Mr President, it is not clear what position the Portuguese Presidency will adopt on Euro-Atlantic cooperation. I would like to go back to the very simple and very sincere request contained in our question. The question was whether this cooperation will be pursued with methods complying with Article 6 of the Treaty as recommended by this Parliament at the completion of the CIA enquiry. We need a clear answer. A joint strategy makes sense if it includes full respect for the fundamental rights of citizens, but this has not always been the case. We welcome the initiative by Vice-President Frattini on a questionnaire to be distributed to the EU Member States to find out what instruments they have put in place and what responses have been produced by these instruments, including in the sphere of respect for the fundamental rights of citizens, but on this point we would like to let you know that this Parliament intends nonetheless to instigate a follow-up to the conclusions of the committee of enquiry on the CIA and to put the formal question: what action have the Council and the Commission taken with regard to the many requests made in those reports? Mr President, in conclusion, I think I can say that combating terrorism requires a high level of social consensus and we need to be vigilant regarding the principles set out in Article 6 of the Treaty. Avoiding abuses and avoiding simplification is the only way of ensuring we achieve this consensus.
costep_2005-05-12_1_87	Distinguished Mr President, I voted for the resolution ‘Future of Europe Sixty Years after the Second World War’ and I want to thank all of my colleagues who supported it. This resolution is a huge moral satisfaction for all who experienced the sufferings of World War II and any violence after it. Many of them no longer live and those who do are thankful that the European Parliament has not forgotten. I thank on behalf of my father, Štefan Kányai, who experienced almost nine years of hell in a Russian gulag. It will be a source of knowledge for young people, who, thank God, have not experienced a war, to learn a lesson from the past and build a free and peaceful future of Europe.
costep_2011-06-23_14_245	European urban diversity must be supported primarily by a flexible mechanism for implementing cohesion policy and by coordinating and adapting urban development projects according to the development needs and strategic guidelines of each city individually. There is talk about smart urban development and about the need for cities to improve and modernise their infrastructure and the services they offer. To ensure that this is not an idle notion, I think that we must put our trust in the local authorities and elected representatives of those cities. We should listen to what communities want, initiate any construction based on their list of priorities and have the belief that mayors know best what are or should be the priorities for their cities. This is precisely why I firmly believe, along with the rapporteur, that the offer of EU funding must meet local demand and the integrated strategic planning principles at EU level. Therefore, the European Urban Agenda must help reduce disparities in the strategic areas which every modern European city needs, namely, infrastructure, research and innovation, transport, environment, education, health and culture. This is because adopting an integrated approach to cohesion policy is the only way in which we will help today’s cities develop in an organic, sustainable and environmentally responsible manner.
costep_2002-07-04_4_153	Mr President, for centuries, Belarus tended to see itself as part of Central Europe and had a close relationship with what is now our Community, but the twentieth century dealt it some appalling blows. First there was the imperialism of Greater Russia, then Stalinism had a particularly cruel effect on it and on the Ukraine, then came Nazi occupation with its crimes - for the war affected White Russia particularly badly - then renewed Soviet colonialism, Chernobyl, the effects of which were particularly felt there, and now, at length, Mr Lukashenko. Mr Lukashenko is a scourge on this country, and has become - thank God, one has to say - a figure unique in modern-day Europe. Since Milosevic fell from power, Mr Lukashenko has in fact come across as a relic of an age which has - thank God - come to an end. It is precisely for that reason that we must do everything possible to support Belarus' democracy movement, which has been suppressed, to act to bring about the release of persecuted journalists, and intervene in defence of the rule of law, democracy and freedom of opinion. We are dealing with one of the last tyrannical regimes in Europe, which must be overcome by peaceful, democratic and lawful means. I therefore consider it right that we turn our attention to this country a second time within a very short period, and we will not cease from doing so until this country is in actual possession of the things we enjoy, namely democracy and the rule of law in accordance with European standards, until this country has also returned to the community of free European peoples. In real terms, this involves us supporting civil rights campaigners, supporting - as Mr Belder pointed out - the independent media, and making it our concern that the spirit of freedom should not be smothered by tyranny, but that that same spirit of freedom should prevail in Belarus as elsewhere.
costep_2010-11-25_9_173	The multiplier effect of pollination, meaning the ratio between the economic value of pollination itself and the value of the honey produced as a result of it, leads to exceptional results in economic terms. Therefore, at a time when all kinds of efficiency are being sought, it does not appear to make sense to give up the activity when the cost/benefit ratio shows how foolish such a decision is. Since the reasons are not to be found in economic factors, but rather in external conditions, I think the Commission’s report hits the mark when it sets out to compare all the factors that currently hamper beekeeping. I also believe it is worth encouraging this activity through collateral measures, and that any scientific contribution in that respect should be welcomed.
costep_2011-06-06_20_10	Madam President, indifferent to the economic and social devastation caused by the structural changes approved by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in countries like Greece, the leaders of the European Union are now stepping up their offensive and launching themselves on Portugal with the same approach and unbridled colonial arrogance. In exchange for a EUR 78 billion loan, a country where the minimum wage is not even EUR 500 will face cuts in wages and pensions, and the closure of public services, as well as being forced to give up national companies and resources. It also faces an increase in the prices of essential goods and services, and EUR 30 billion in interest, which equates to around 40% of the total loan. More than two-thirds of this interest will go to the European Union itself. This is the meaning of the much-vaunted European solidarity. Persisting in this course of action will inevitably lead to an intensification of the social struggle which has been raging throughout Europe, including Portugal. We are, and will continue to be, here to support and encourage it, certain that only through such struggle can change be instigated, and an alternative that is needed increasingly urgently put in place in Europe.
costep_1998-03-30_6_14	Mr President, this is the second consecutive part-session during which tourism has occupied an important place. During the previous part-session, the subject was tourism and the euro, and today we are discussing the protection of tourists as consumers in Mr Aparicio Sánchez' interesting report, on which I would like to congratulate him. First and foremost, I consider it important to emphasize that such protection involves familiarity with and respect for contracts entered into by tourists with tourism agencies and agents and with transporters. In this regard, unacceptable situations exist - which should be prevented - such as those connected with the need for transparent information on prices, validity, alterations and compensation, luggage allowance, etcetera. Also, for air transporters there is the matter of using aircraft owned by other companies since this is a mode of transport in which safety considerations are extremely sensitive, and such changes therefore deserve particular attention, as I sought to emphasize in my opinion on air transport and company agreements. Furthermore, as the rapporteur states, measures are required in connection with the practise of overbooking, both for transport and in the hotel sector. I would like briefly to touch on two points that are also mentioned by the rapporteur and which I consider to be important. The first relates to the attention that should be given to rural tourism, particularly in the light of its potential positive impact on peripheral and ultra-peripheral regions. In this respect, I consider it extremely important to draw attention to the matter of cultural information that should go hand in hand with this tourism. My second point relates to the type of tourism that generates considerable seasonal and/or periodic influxes, of the kind that are considerably in excess of that occasioned by normal flows of tourists which are already irregular by nature: I refer to religious tourism which can attract an annual population of over 5 million to a town intended for a few thousand inhabitants. Fatima is a case in point, with all the attendant repercussions as regards development planning and basic amenities. This type of tourism calls for special attention and appropriate protective measures. Finally, in discussing the subject of tourist protection, thought must also be given to eradicating the types of tourism which threaten society. I am talking about paedophile tourism which cannot be justified in any light, nor a blind eye turned when foreign currency is being earned.
costep_2005-06-06_1_19	Mr President, I am taking the floor on my own behalf and on behalf of Mr Pittella, Mr Yáñez and Mrs Madeira, to protest at the discrimination against Asturias, Murcia, Melilla, Ceuta, Basilicata and the Algarve in Mr Juncker’s documents. The President-in-Office of the Council spoke in a very discerning way following the French referendum. He said that politicians should make decisions understandable to the public and react. That is precisely what we are requesting for these six European regions: to prevent injustice and marginalisation compared to others who are in the same circumstances. Mr Juncker, in your coming document you must remove the precedent of marginalising three million citizens. It is a question of dignity, of making European policy comprehensible, of making it fair and democratic, true to its roots and to its ambitions. Mr Juncker, we place our trust in you.
costep_2007-02-14_11_22	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report makes it a good day for Parliament for a number of reasons. First of all, the inseparable links between economic, social and environmental policy have, as has already been pointed out, gone beyond the level of trite statements and can now be seen in practice. We need only compare the title and the content to appreciate this shift. The report states quite plainly how long this has been on the books of the Community institutions. The economic policy guidelines need to include the social and environmental dimensions, in the sense that these are the most important aspects of them. It is not just a case of combining three equivalent areas in the best way possible, but of recognising that economic development is based on social cohesion and environmental alertness. Secondly, since competitiveness requires compatibility, action is needed in specific sectors, such as research and development, energy and the environment, as well as equally specific objectives for creating full employment and good quality jobs, guaranteeing dignity and security for people in work, and addressing calls for flexibility from both sides of the employer-worker relationship by means of measures aiming not just at conciliation but also at worker redeployment. In addition, since the coordination method can provide useful results, it is not only good practice that should be pointed out and exchanged, but also obstacles, difficulties and adverse outcomes. Great care is always needed when going down the road of harmonisation, since it is important to take account of contexts and legal systems; they may appear similar, but they retain their own peculiarities. However, understanding not only the proposal but also the implementation procedure and the impact caused will facilitate everybody’s work at European, national and regional levels. The final reason is that national decisions must in turn follow an integrated, cross-cutting approach, and the prearranged plans and priorities must be reflected in the national budgets.
costep_2011-06-08_7_514	Divergences in contract law in the Member States create structural problems that discourage businesses and consumers. Mrs Wallis’s motion for a resolution favours the creation of an optional instrument for European contract law for consumers and businesses by virtue of a general regulation, and this is why I voted in favour of the text. Furthermore, the instrument would not replace Member States' contract laws, but would merely help ensure a better choice of contract model between the parties, thanks to examples based on general principles, definitions and model regulations for both commercial and consumer contracts, without going against the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
costep_1999-09-15_3_11	Madam President, like the previous speakers, I believe that, firstly, the creation of a European judicial area and, secondly, the introduction of general regulations for the control of immigration, will not contribute in any way towards solving the problems of cross-border crime or immigration. This is just another decoy being waved in front of public opinion in Europe in order to deceive people into thinking that Europe is capable of solving their problems. I would like to speak, anticipating a little bit, about the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference; this conference is actually already on course without us however knowing the exact conditions. The European elections demonstrated the very deep disaffection of the various peoples of Europe with regard to the European Union. The questions which public opinion has been wondering about may be summed up as follows: where exactly does Europe offer added value and improve these decision-making systems of ours? Has Europe brought us greater economic growth, an improved standard of living in daily life or the expectation of participating in a great adventure? The response given in many countries, starting with the Netherlands - which in fact surprised me a little, because it was in the Netherlands that the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty of Amsterdam were signed - has been negative. More and more people are starting to have doubts about the value of the fast track to integration and indeed about the value of the Treaties which Mr Barnier, who has moved all the way from Gaullism to centrism finding no middle ground, would like to see enshrined in the constitution. But, Mr Bourlanges, thirty years ago you were a Gaullist and now you are the opposite of a Gaullist, since you are a centrist. In other words, the subject of the forthcoming IGC should be not to reinforce this institutional process but, on the contrary, to reduce it, that is to say, to limit the scope of activities of the Union, returning to a common market which respects the environment and public health. Moreover, Mr Lamy, the Commissioner-delegate, described the building of Europe as a phenomenon without historical determinism, a human and fragile endeavour. He doubted that there was really a future The President cut the speaker off
costep_2011-02-03_9_49	I voted in favour of the Regulation establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation. The objective of European Union development policy is to reduce, and ultimately, eradicate poverty. It supports the efforts of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries to reduce poverty and ensure sustainable economic and social development. The European Union is committed to supporting the smooth and gradual integration of developing countries into the world economy with a view to sustainable development. The main ACP banana-exporting countries may face challenges in the context of changing trade arrangements, notably liberalisation of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff in the framework of the World Trade Organisation and the bilateral and regional agreements concluded, or in the process of being concluded, between the Union and Latin American countries. The financial assistance measures to be adopted under the programme should aim at improving the living standards and living conditions of people in banana-growing areas and in banana value chains, specifically small farmers and small entities, as well as ensuring compliance with labour and occupational health and safety standards, and environmental standards, notably those regarding the use of and exposure to pesticides. The measures should therefore also support the adaptation, including, when relevant, the reorganisation, of areas dependent upon banana exports through sector-specific budget support or project-specific interventions.
costep_2000-02-03_2_49	Jörg Haider’s rise to power, with the inauguration of a conservative right-wing and FPÖ coalition government, is a sign of the terrible revival in Europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth. The success of the Austrian Freedom Party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the Austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter, whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right-wing populism. The resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of Fascism. It can be explained by the feeling of helplessness of the people who are the victims of the ideology of mighty Mammon and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and deregulation ever further. In order to oppose the xenophobic statements of an apprentice dictator who is nostalgic for the Third Reich, we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austrians opposed to Fascism. This is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypocritical references to a 'European democratic model' which bears more resemblance to a fortress which tracks downs, expels and imprisons immigrants without the proper papers, when it is not opening files on teenagers.
costep_2011-06-08_13_18	Madam President, the partnership between the European Union and Russia entails responsibility, including towards third countries. I would like to draw the Commission’s attention to the paragraph of the resolution which calls on Russia not to use the supply of energy resources as a tool for influencing its neighbours' policies. This is what has happened in the case of Ukraine, where Mr Putin, the Russian Prime Minister, said quite openly during his last meeting with Mr Azarov, the Ukrainian Prime Minister, that lower prices would only be offered and the gas contract renegotiated if Ukraine entered into a customs union with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, which would mean abandoning its European plans and aspirations. This is nothing short of blackmail. If the contract is not renegotiated, gas prices on the Russia-Ukraine border may reach EUR 500 per 1 000 m3. Ukraine is already paying the highest prices in Europe for Russian gas, although it is closest to the sources of this gas. This situation may result in a very serious economic and social crisis in Ukraine. I would like to make it clear that the European Union has obligations towards Ukraine, given that we are currently successfully negotiating the country’s entry into a free trade area or the creation of such an area, and will, in the near future, engage in relations with it as an ally of the European Union. I would call on the Commission to demand quite plainly that Russia ceases all such practices and puts a stop to them.
costep_2002-01-16_4_2	Mr President, I would like to point out, in addition to this, that we want to submit a second report. We hope that the Commission is also of the opinion that there should be a compromise with the position taken by Parliament, whose Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is well known to have voted the first proposal down, but which is now prepared to draw up a new proposal in the Katiforis report, one which we are keen to present to the whole House in February. In February, the Council of Finance Ministers will still have enough time to come to a decision about it. Accordingly, I have also written to the Spanish Presidency of the Council on the Committee’s behalf, and have also informed the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Rato of it during last week’s meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. That being so, I do not think that the request for urgent procedure should be agreed to.
costep_1998-10-05_4_24	Mr President, Mrs d'Ancona has produced a thorough report on this subject. This second report is clearly a more rational, more composed and, above all, more constructive one than its predecessor. I believe that the long and stormy parliamentary debate on Mrs d'Ancona’s reports has strengthened the view of most that the battle against drugs cannot be won by proposing that the harmonisation of EU Member States' drug laws should be achieved merely in terms of a liberal approach to the drugs problem. We are all, in our own way, victims of drug abuse. The fight against drugs in the Member States of the Community must be an active, not a reactive, one. Simply focusing on the control of problems that are the result of drug abuse is not the right approach. The debate on synthetic drugs has shown that the EU should be giving special attention to educational programmes for children and young people. The fight against the various designer drugs used by young people, such as ecstasy, is the only way to make it difficult for people to get hold of drugs. We urgently need to develop and enhance systems for sharing information among the relevant authorities and setting up joint databases for the registration of new narcotic substances, with the help of EU funding. I would finally like to point out that the opinions being expressed in the gallery are, to my mind, out of order, Mr President.
costep_2001-07-04_5_21	Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of this House and the Commission to a matter which has been dealt with brilliantly in the report, a matter which is certainly less tragic than the physical violation of human rights which, I am sad to say, lies before us now, but which relates to a crucial, pivotal factor in the democratic processes of all countries and, above all - I am convinced - in the future of democracy in European and world societies: I refer to the issue of information, to a question which I feel to be central, the question of pluralism - and I will repeat this word, pluralism - of information. At a time when this is becoming increasingly important, in a historic period in which television, in particular, is becoming an incredibly powerful and influential mass medium in the history of humanity, securing the pluralism of information in Europe means securing the basis for a democratic future. Failure to guarantee this means exposing our countries and our area to hazards. In my opinion, the question gains in importance precisely when we consider it in relation to enlargement, for countries are joining the Union whose experience is different, countries are acceding which have a greater need for tangible rules than ever before. Well then, Europe does not have these tangible rules. The Commission has been instigating and developing initial proposals for directives since the 1990s and the European Parliament has elaborated on these ideas on a number of occasions, but everything appears to have come to a standstill. An idea also seems to be circulating which I consider to be dangerous: that world competition, particularly North American competition, should promote mergers rather than guarantee pluralism. If that is the case, then I say to you that this is a great mistake. The greater good, the greatest good is democracy. I call upon Parliament and the Commission to address this issue and to produce a directive on the matter without delay.
costep_2000-02-02_9_5	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse my late arrival, but this other political issue is still on the agenda today, more is the pity. The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million, and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need. The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there. However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process. Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents. Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions. I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future. It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this. However, we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here. One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims. In other words, we should ensure that the money falls to Mr Kouchner’s sphere of competence and not to other spheres. Secondly, even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there, we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into. This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations. It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe, in the interests of the persons affected. This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms, that is to say, not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east Europe, and with the aid delivered there. This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence. We have so many coordinators, who, in turn, are responsible to so many employers, that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators. Perhaps it would be better, however, if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations, were to get together some time to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there. I know that the Commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this, but if the European Union is doing the most work out there, then it should also be given the leadership, and bring coherence to the situation, so that we can be of real assistance to the people. It makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground! Bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed - it is now set for the end of March - that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline, that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented, and there is a steady stream of new press conferences, this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of Europe! Accordingly, we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative, so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month. Rather, we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country, and I hope that in the process, you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months.
costep_2003-09-25_4_53	The Commission wants to update the legislation that has governed the financial markets since 1993, a central, structural element in the creation of a European capital market, the final objective of the financial services action plan included in the 'Lisbon Strategy'. The report supports the main thrusts of this directive, despite the differences in ISD model championed by the investment capital lobbies - between the choice of a model known as the 'Anglo-Saxon' model, in which investment firms compete fiercely with the stock exchanges, backing the City of London and opening the door to US investment capital, and a system known as the 'continental' system, more firmly based on the stock exchanges and preferred by French investment capital. What is at stake, then, is market domination by the investment capital of one country or another, while the degree of liberalisation of such capital and its various operators increases, raising enormous amounts of capital through pension funds and the privatisation of social security. At the same time, elementary prudential rules and the transparency of operations are also at stake because of their cost. This objective, which we reject, is supposed to be efficient, but has contributed to the increased instability and volatility of the financial markets, with impacts on the real economy and consequences for economic growth and jobs.
costep_2006-10-24_5_2	Madam President, Commissioner Špidla, Commissioner Kyprianou, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the chairmen of the three committees, Mrs Záborská, Mr Florenz and Mr Andersson, most warmly for their fantastic cooperation in preparing this debate. I would also like to thank you, Madam President. Breast cancer was on the agenda three years ago, and it is now time to take an initial look at the results, which appears to be urgently necessary. In the 25 Member States, 275 000 women contract breast cancer every year. The risk of dying from it is twice as high in one Member State as in another. To make it worse, younger and younger women are contracting the disease: just in the last few years, the number of women under 40 affected has doubled. Breast cancer is still the number one cause of death in women between 35 and 55. However, I am also shocked at how radical treatment still is in many Member States. In some countries, mastectomies are still the rule rather than the exception, even in the very early stages of the disease, even though in 80% of cases these days it is possible to operate without removing the breast. As you can see, then, we are progressing at a snail’s pace. This is particularly true in the new Member States, where the missed opportunities and deficiencies throughout the chain of care are at their worst. However, at least in the old Member States, the fact that the structures remain, as before, inadequate to catastrophic has less to do with public budget problems than with the economic and class interests of the doctors. Let us begin with early detection: the development of an across-the-board breast screening programme according to EU guidelines will involve a one-off cost for the public purse of no more than EUR 1.25 per citizen. I am therefore sure that nobody in this House wants to claim that this money is not available. If we had an EU-wide breast screening programme, we could save the lives of 31 000 women in the EU a year, help to reduce healthcare costs and substantially reduce subsequent costs for the whole of society. To date, though, only 11 countries have a quality-assured screening programme, and these programmes are a long way from being continuous. In your country, too, Mr Špidla, you must put a stop to the practice of passing off opportunistic screening as EU screening. In Cyprus, too, Mr Kyprianou, progress is still very sluggish. Now we know, of course, that you are both on our side, but it would nonetheless have been nice to have the Commission’s progress report now, instead of in the Spring, which is when it is expected. We also call on you to put greater emphasis on the option of using money from the Structural Funds to develop a screening programme. However, even the best early detection system is of no use if subsequent treatment is inadequate or inappropriate. Time and again, breast cancer is operated on and treated in hospitals with barely any experience. I would therefore specifically like to thank the Commission for the EU guidelines for breast centres, which we have received from you since last year. The ball is now in the Member States' court, though, because the only place in the whole of the EU with such centres at the moment is - amazingly - the United Kingdom. That is why we will also call today, in our joint resolution, for the Member States to establish sufficient breast centres nationwide by 2016. This is absolutely feasible by 2016. We would need around 1 800 such centres EU-wide. Then all women would have the opportunity to get the same optimum treatment, regardless of where they live. In order to ensure that these breast centres actually work in accordance with the EU criteria, that they really do perform a minimum number of operations on primary breast cancer, namely 150 a year in a single centre, that the specialists really have specialised exclusively in benign and malignant breast diseases and that they really do carry out interdisciplinary consultations before and after the operation for each case of breast cancer, we now also need guidelines for the certification of breast centres. In this connection, we would call on you in the Commission to embark on drafting these guidelines with real speed. We would also ask you to draw up guidelines for the job description of breast nurses, who have a very important role to play in these centres, as guides and mediators between doctors and patients throughout the treatment process. Applause
costep_1999-12-15_6_36	Mr President, this time I voted against the Hulthén report. The European Community has the delicate task of deciding how best to proceed as regards making further progress on the one hand and considering the care, health and environment of our great great great grandchildren on the other. I therefore think that before adopting any measure, we must ascertain, by consulting scientists and experts who are constantly making scientific progress, whether it is right to continue with the ban on certain substances in the future and whether, on the basis of the research carried out by scientists, every step we take really is important. What I mean is that we have to realise that we are not as good at predicting the future as we unfortunately think we are.
costep_2000-07-04_2_32	Mr President, I would like to repudiate in the strongest possible terms, the accusation levelled at me by Mr Dell'Alba that I used my role as rapporteur for the discharge of the budget for the 1998 financial year for personal ends - I repeat, for personal ends - and his comment that as a German, I, or rather, we Germans, if I understood the translation correctly, would do well to put our own house in order. It went beyond personal insult and such verbal attacks are unworthy of our Parliament. I urge you to take suitable steps towards ensuring that Mr Dell'Alba avails himself of democratic manners like everyone else, even if - as I readily grant him - he obviously finds it difficult!
costep_2011-06-07_15_58	I thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for his excellent report, which fits in with the recent debate on the implementation of the Schengen Agreement. The existence of effective controls along our external borders must be an important factor inasmuch as the security of the Schengen area depends on the efficiency with which each Member State controls its external borders. Although some problems remain unresolved, Romania and Bulgaria have proved to be sufficiently prepared to apply all the requirements of the Schengen acquis. We have discussed at length the practical efficacy of the state machinery of these two countries, as well as their levels of corruption; nevertheless, I believe that the application of Schengen should leave this out of consideration, given that - just as happened with the other Member States - it is sufficient to base a decision only on the efficiency of border controls and the preparation of police forces. Adding further requirements would create a precedent of discrimination which has not existed before, not even after the great enlargement in 2007.
costep_2011-04-07_7_158	This motion for a resolution relates to the 2010 progress report on Iceland’s advances towards European Union membership. Negotiations on Iceland’s accession started in July 2010. I believe that the necessary conditions need to be created for completing Iceland’s accession process and ensuring the success of this accession: this is a country with a strong democratic tradition and a robust civic culture, and its accession will strengthen the Union’s role in promoting the defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world. Iceland belongs to the European Free Trade Association, and has a market economy that could provide certain advantages to the EU, specifically in the area of renewable energy. Nonetheless, Iceland needs to provide evidence of real interest, and to cooperate on the resolution of outstanding issues in the fisheries management sector. According to the report that has been tabled, some progress has been made, but there is still a long way to go, particularly with regard to the fisheries sector. I hope that these outstanding issues can be quickly resolved, so that Iceland’s accession process is a success.
costep_2005-05-12_1_115	The political institutions can have but one communication strategy: truth and transparency, in tandem with a readiness to listen as much as to make ourselves heard. Even if it is true that the vast majority of Europe’s citizens feel close to the essence of the spirit of the EU, it is nonetheless also true that that there is a sense of alienation when it comes to its day-to-day running, and with regard to the content of some of its texts. The prime objective is, therefore, by means of transparency and truth, and complete respect for pluralism, to increase the visibility of what the Union is, and to pay attention to what the citizens are saying. There are two sides to all forms of communication and this is one of its most democratic characteristics. Let us therefore take this on board.
costep_2006-11-29_13_14	Mr President, our relations with Russia are of strategic importance. Looking at the developments in the Middle East and considering the use made of Russia in the Security Council in matters relating to problem areas such as Iran and North Korea, we know that it is in our interests to have Russia on our side when dealing with these. We also know that mandate to negotiate a new partnership and cooperation agreement is to be extended to include the incorporation into that agreement of matters touching on energy security, democracy and human rights in Russia, and, if that is to be done, then negotiations are necessary, and a veto, by preventing the resolution of such issues, is not helpful. At the same time, though, it strikes me as of the utmost importance that the Commission and the Council, in the course of their negotiations, should bear it in mind - and you can use this as an argument, if you like - that any such agreement must, at the end of the day, be ratified by Parliament and that we will not accept an agreement that does not include certain conditions that are decisive in terms of solidarity between all Member States of the European Union. I would like to address one thing that makes it clear that it is self-evidently in our own strategic interest if the European Union acts as one in foreign policy matters, while also making clear that solidarity can be manifested also in smaller matters such as, for example, the issue of trade with Poland. If the impression is given that we are up in arms about the trade measures of a third country when they affect Germany, or the United Kingdom, or France, and make a great song and dance about it, smaller or newer Member States get the idea that their problems are not treated as being equally important, and we end up with a credibility problem. In view of the way in which this issue of trade between Russia and Poland has been handled so far, I can quite understand what the Poles are getting at. No actions are now being taken against a single country, quite simply because there is now only one trade policy. I therefore ask the Commission, and the member of it with responsibility for trade matters, to put this on the priority list in future, something that was not done for Poland, or, indeed, in the matter between Iran and Denmark three-quarters of a year ago. I think the Commission has to come to understand that this sends an important message to the people living in the Member States, that message being that we take their concerns seriously and care about them. That makes it easier to achieve agreement on other matters.
costep_2010-03-11_9_22	The EU cannot have a romantic vision of the political regime in Cuba, which is a genuine communist dictatorship, based on the logic of a single party that violates human rights, oppresses its citizens, persecutes and eliminates political adversaries and imprisons countless people simply for the offence of having an opinion. The death of Orlando Zapata was just one more case to shock the world that the European Parliament must condemn firmly, without hesitation and false justifications. That is why I reject the attempts of some members of the far left to dress up this appalling crime in political terms, which are only intended to legitimise a regime that is neither tolerable nor acceptable.
costep_1999-11-15_4_6	Madam President, my colleague, Mr Lange, has again produced an excellent report, which will have a considerable effect on air quality, and our Group unreservedly supports it. Trucks and buses contribute to air pollution in ever greater proportions, as we have actually done a lot to reduce car emissions, for example by using better quality fuels and tax concessions, as Mrs Myller said. In the first reading, Parliament was very successful in getting through strict limit values for particulate pollutants, which are very dangerous for the health. The Ministers of the Environment then adopted Parliament’s proposal and now our job is to demand that industry adopts just as strict a line on nitrogen emissions. Industry needs sufficient time, and industry will certainly get the time it needs to prepare itself for this technological change. The engineers have proved very inventive before, and I trust that the right technology will be in place by 2006.
costep_2010-03-08_19_6	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as both the rapporteur and the Commissioner have observed, this proposal for a directive does indeed follow a vote in Parliament. Nevertheless, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is still critical of this proposal, because it risks being turned against the people we want to support. In wishing to lighten the load for businesses, we risk depriving them of the conditions of transparency and trust that are indispensable to their management and to the dynamism of their activity. First of all, I believe that we must be clear about the thresholds and on what exactly a micro-entity is. It is a small or medium-sized enterprise with more than 10 employees and a turnover in excess of EUR 1 million. Whichever Member State you look at, that represents the large majority of businesses. It may be true that they are local and have little presence in the Community market, but that does not mean that accounting rules will be abolished for them. They will have to confront accounting rules whenever they want to deal with a banking body or with partners, or negotiate with fiscal, economic and social institutions. Accounting rules will then be imposed on them and they may have to pay a higher price than they would for ordinary accounting in order to satisfy criteria that they will not necessarily overcome. I do not want to see progress towards a system in which the obligation to draw up annual accounts is then imposed outside of the common European Union framework. That is not just a problem of competition. It is a quite simply an issue of economic integration and Community law, and of equal treatment for all businesses in the European Union. Having said that, it is quite clear that the simplification of the accounting obligations for SMEs is necessary. There are, incidentally, three initiatives working towards that aim: the proposal that we are discussing today; the International Financial Reporting Standards system; and the review of the fourth and seventh Accounting Directives, on which the European Commission should soon be making some proposals. We were promised these proposals for 2010. It would seem that the period has been extended, but I do not think that this extension is reason enough to rush and do a half-hearted job, for these three proposals, whilst sharing the same purpose, will perhaps not be articulated in the same way and it seems to me, Commissioner, to be preferable and clearer for businesses if we give them a single, general response allowing them to reconcile the simplification of obligations that everyone wants with the reality of life in the small businesses that need it. The current problem is that the European Commission is delaying in proposing a review of these directives, which is detrimental to our consideration of the issue. I therefore call on the European Commission to speed up the dialogue on this issue of exemption, which is currently dividing both economic institutions and economic circles in Europe, and to prepare an impact assessment.
costep_1999-12-13_10_9	Mr President, I think that in this final debate, before voting on this regulation, the following points must be stressed: My country, Spain, fully enters into the spirit of the Montreal Protocol and is committed to fulfilling its terms in a completely responsible and active way. It accepts, in general terms therefore, the common position and in this sense, I fully agree with the intervention by my colleague Mrs Flemming. Nevertheless, this is no obstacle to Spain, with its firm desire to carry out the eradication of the use of specific toxic substances that damage the ozone layer, which regards itself as being particularly affected by the banning of one of them, methyl bromide, which was referred to a while ago. This substance, which is used as an agricultural disinfectant mainly in clearly defined farming zones in the Mediterranean regions is already strictly limited in my country in terms of its marketing and use and has already been replaced in all cases for which suitable alternatives have been found. Work has been done for quite a while on investigating replacement substances in order to meet the deadline laid down in the Protocol. Precisely because we want to comply with the standard, we have to be very careful when it comes to weighing up our ability to do so, if Parliament approves a regulation that makes the conditions and the time-scales tougher. It would be more honest and above all more practical to state clearly that we see that there is a possibility that we will not be able to comply where methyl bromide is concerned. At the very least this will cause us to suffer serious financial and social consequences and the competitiveness of some of our agricultural products will be damaged in relation to other countries that do not apply the same restrictions. We will not be able to ensure that the use of methyl bromide stops by shortening the time-scales. Instead, we run the risk of unwillingly failing to comply and the possibility of fraud which will produce the opposite result to the one we all want to see. Therefore, the Spanish delegation of the European People’s Party feels that it is necessary to uphold in the plenary sitting the amendments relating to the first paragraph of Article 3(2) and the last paragraph of Article 21 in which the exceptions and conditions for the use of methyl bromide after 2006 are specified. We think that Parliament must set standards that all Member States should be able to fulfil without experiencing serious damage to their economic, social and environmental conditions. It is this spirit, not an emotionally praiseworthy but unrealistic environmental good will, which leads us to put forward these amendments today.
costep_2002-11-19_2_82	Mr President, after today’s debate, I understand why Turkey is calling upon the forthcoming December Council to set a date for the start of the negotiations. I support Turkey’s request, for what is happening here is a farce, started by Mr Giscard d'Estaing and continuing today in this Chamber. Here, we are not discussing whether Turkey is fulfilling the conditions it needs to fulfil in order to become a member of the Union in the near future - and we can be rigorous in demanding that it does fulfil them - we are opening a debate on whether or not Turkey is to be allowed to join the Union in the future and wondering whether a different sort of association might be appropriate. We are going back on decisions already made and reopening the debate on the opening of a line of credit for a major country - a country which is essential to Europe and the West - which has applied to become a full member of the Union. Personally, I support the line taken by Mr Brok in his report and his resolution, where he calls for greater pre-accession cooperation from the Commission and for the Council to adopt a position which is more in line with that expressed on occasions by Parliament, but I do not support the Ferber amendment - which I will vote against tomorrow - in that if it were to be adopted, the whole approach of the Brok report and resolution would be turned upside down and they would make no sense. There are good reasons for what I am saying: we have a duty to be unambiguous towards a major country which practises moderate Islam, is pro the West, which could have great cultural significance on our borders and could give substance to a Union foreign and security policy. I hope that, tomorrow, we will reject the Ferber amendment - as a member of the European People’s Party I will do so - and we will thus be able to take a step in that direction.
costep_2011-03-09_11_213	We have just adopted by a large majority the EU strategy on Roma inclusion. This is a strong political signal confirming that the European Union is aware of its responsibility towards this minority, which is the largest one in Europe, as well as the most persecuted one. The European Union and the Member States must tackle the disgraceful segregation suffered by the Roma head-on. This report stresses the importance of respecting the fundamental rights of the Roma and, in particular, access to education. To avoid any risk of marginalisation, it is also important to implement innovative policies on genuine access to employment, and to enable these people, the vast majority of whom are permanently settled, to access decent and affordable housing. The EU funds are there. They must be used in a way that will benefit the Roma. It is now up to the European Commission to draft final provisions based on the proposals in this report in a coherent manner with the principle of subsidiarity and with one aim: to ensure that the Roma become fully fledged European citizens.
costep_2010-06-15_11_16	Mr President, I would like to ask you to say once again whether you believe that the directive on environmental liability for sub sea oil and gas production is sufficient. I would like to know whether you believe that the non-uniform, relatively low upper limits on liability are really what we need in the light of the catastrophe in the Gulf. I would also like to know whether you are debating urgent improvements to technical inspections on platforms. Do you really believe that the environmental and climatic conditions in the Arctic are friendly enough to humans and technology for us to enter into the risks of sub sea oil production there too? It may not be quite as deep as in the Gulf of Mexico, but the conditions are tough.
costep_2011-04-07_7_3	Madam President, this was an extremely important subject for debate, and I think that it would have been important if Parliament had sent a clear message that we are very worried about what happened. We want to show the public that we are doing all we can to make nuclear power plants in Europe and in the world generally as safe as possible. We also, however, want to show that we can continue with nuclear power when there is greater certainty over the issue. It is a pity, however, that the majority here voted against this, and that the clear message was therefore not sent today.
costep_2011-03-23_16_36	Mr President, I will be very happy to answer, although I did not want to turn a European Parliament debate into a debate on Portuguese politics. In fact, if Mrs Estrela wants to debate Portuguese politics, she has a simple solution: we must have elections, stand as a candidate for the Portuguese Parliament and she will have the opportunity, in opposition, to debate the policies intended for Portugal with the Portuguese Social Democratic Party. I would just say the following: we cannot take another government that has failed four times in two years. It is impossible, it is unsustainable and the markets do not find it credible: there are no more solutions with the Portuguese Socialist Party in government. The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question (Rule 149(8 of the Rules of Procedure))
costep_2000-04-11_9_12	Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I was a member of the delegation from our Group which visited Turkey. I do not want to recount my experiences at length, I just want to tell you what my impression was. It was one of disappointment. I am extremely disappointed that four months after obtaining candidate status, nothing serious has yet been done to move towards compliance with the Copenhagen criteria, especially the political criteria. Commissioner, you mentioned the interministerial committee. It is true that numerous structures are being set up. I have been aware of this in Turkey since 1995. If they are obliged to comply with something, they start by setting up committees and commissions, interministerial, extraministerial, every sort of committee under the sun. The structures are superb, we can all agree on that. Except that they do nothing. For example, it would have been very easy without any committees, without any commissions, to abolish Article 312 of the Criminal Code; all it needed was a vote in the Turkish Grand National Assembly and that would have freed a whole series of intellectuals, authors, journalists and the very same Akin Birdal from jail. That is how easy it is to take the first steps. The Turks tell us they need time, they need a great deal of time, because this reform can only be achieved one step at a time. I warned you about that. I told you that numerous fellow Members here in this very House, in the European Parliament, were prepared to allow as much time as they needed, 200 years, 400 years, even more. But I belong to a Group which enthusiastically helped Turkey to achieve candidate status, not just so that Turkey could be a candidate but to give Turkey a real chance to become a member and start negotiations. Which is why we want to insist and want to press for Turkey to be helped on its way with a road map and a specific timetable and, of course the accession partnership which the Commissioner referred to earlier, and not just to remain a candidate.
costep_2001-09-06_9_9	Mr President, the resolution calls for the release of Yawovi Agboyibo, the opponent of the dictator, General Eyadema. We support this resolution in that respect, but we wish to make it clear that those who approve the policies of the great Western powers are not in a position to be indignant now, because this dictatorship, which has oppressed the people of Togo since 1967, could not have persisted without the support of the great powers, and particularly of France. One might therefore question the usefulness of a resolution adopted by Parliament, when the present dictator is then welcomed with as an honoured guest of our governments, and when he continues to receive subsidies that allow him to buy the arms that keep him in power. Cambodia
costep_1998-11-18_15_6	Madam President, the cohesion policy is an element of solidarity for the most disadvantaged regions. The regions that are a priority for aid, as defined by the Commission, are the Objective 1 regions, which are those with an income that is less than 75 % of the European average. For this definition the autonomous community or region is used as a point of reference. This procedure may seem fair, but one change needs to be made. There are areas that, although they are not as large as a region, have objective needs, and their income is unfortunately below the level required. For this reason there must be exceptions, which are, of course, limited, so that those areas can be Objective 1 and can take priority in receiving aid. There are various areas of this type in the European Union. One example is the area made up of the left bank of the Nervión and Ayala in the Basque Country. It has 350 000 inhabitants, with an income that is below 75 % of the European average, a level of unemployment above 20 %, a socio-economic fabric that urgently needs revitalising and, what is more, is an area adjoining two autonomous communities that are currently Objective 1: Castilla-León and Cantabria. Therefore, including the left bank of the Nervión and Ayala in Objective 1 would leave no island in the European aid map. It would be an act of solidarity towards its inhabitants and a essential element in revitalising investment and economic activity in the area and in creating jobs. It is therefore necessary to consider the possibility of taking account of exceptions in the Objective 1 map, so that specific and objective needs for support will have their share of the Structural Funds, above and beyond political and administrative limits. There is another aspect of the Commission’s proposal that we must modify. Aid for training and employment for the new Objective 3 could be lost for Objective 2 areas: industrial areas. This would be a complete contradiction in terms. Where are training and human resources more needed than in areas that are undergoing industrial change? It is only through this concept and through this modification that the Basque Country, as well as other industrial areas of Europe, will be able to continue to receive around 8 billion pesetas every year. I hope that Parliament will tomorrow be in favour of using that Fund for training in Objective 2 areas that are undergoing industrial change, because if training is needed for employment anywhere in Europe, it is undoubtedly needed in areas like these that have a high level of unemployment and where a considerable amount of effort is being made in industrial and technological change.
costep_2005-05-12_1_30	Commissioner, as I see it there are three issues that require an appropriate and rapid response from the Commission. The textile, clothing and footwear market provides us with an excellent example of how Chinese imports can destroy a market, and have a knock-on effect on other sectors. The first issue that needs to be addressed is the length of time it takes the Commission to act, as well as the fact that the misguided decisions it takes are not only damaging, but unfortunately sometimes also irreversible. The second issue relates to the liberalisation of the EU market, the consequences of which have included a sudden influx of subsidised imports, such as subsidised coal. This has led to price competition that has given rise to so much concern and has eventually ruined the coal market. This has made matters even worse for the mining industry, even though the efforts of the latter go towards meeting the EU’s energy needs. The third and final issue relates to the preferential trade agreements concluded when the EU still had only 15 Member States. It is time to revise the customs agreement and the preferential quotas, taking the interests of the enlarged EU into account, as at present the trade displacement effect does not always give rise to the relevant creation effect. By way of example, agricultural and food products from the United States are still keeping goods from the 10 new Member States off the EU market.
costep_2001-03-13_11_47	I can remember the 1950s, when most people believed that nuclear fission would yield unlimited resources of clean and safe energy in future. A number of countries subsequently built nuclear power stations as if there were no tomorrow, and the electricity supply was made largely dependent on nuclear fission. The 1960s saw the beginning of mounting criticism, especially when it transpired that nuclear power stations can explode and that the waste product continues to threaten the environment for a very long period of time. The disasters in Harrisburg and Chernobyl had a decelerating effect on the further development of nuclear energy, and some countries have either abandoned it completely by now or are in the process of doing so. But even after that, we will be facing dangerous radioactive waste for many thousands of years. Given the risks involved in transporting this kind of waste, the best solution is to bury it in the nuclear power stations which are condemned for closure and not to transport it to another location. There are many campaigns to stop these transports, and rightly so. The rapporteur is showing some degree of understanding for those campaigns and wants to curb the risks, but continues to allow and justify further transport of this kind. I do not subscribe to this point of view. Schwaiger Report A5-0076/2001
costep_2010-10-18_15_7	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your responses and I must confess that I am perplexed, because on the one hand, the Commission says that if we want more information, we must go and knock on the door of the Member States. This can only be interpreted one way: the Commission says that it has no ability to put pressure on the Member States or to intervene in this matter. On the other hand, however, it then says that the Commission asked the US Government not to request data which undermine access to European databases. I do not understand why the Commission thinks that it is easier to go and ask the US Government instead of establishing contacts with the Member States and the governments of the EU Member States. I must confess that there seems to me to be only one explanation for this: it shows that the Commission is in a weak position and means that the concerns that Parliament has expressed on this matter make complete sense. We are primarily concerned with the fact that the US has used a 'divide and conquer' strategy, apparently with impunity. Secondly, we are concerned with the fact that several Member States have decided to pursue bilateral relations and negotiations, showing a certain lack of European solidarity. Yet we are also worried about the attitude of resignation and shirking of responsibility on the part of the European institutions, which does not give us any greater power in negotiation. Europe must have a voice on this issue. We must ensure that there is no access to databases through bilateral agreements. Moreover, the cloak of secrecy that surrounds these negotiations, the fact that certain representatives from the Member States or national parliaments have revealed the contents of Memoranda of Understanding, and the fact that this Parliament continues to lack information on this issue, are fundamental reasons to back up our concern, and this has not been resolved by the answers that the Commission has just given.
costep_2010-11-11_9_144	I voted in favour of the resolution since I believe it to be a fair and balanced document. It is important for Parliament to make its opinion heard on this important summit with our greatest ally. Transatlantic relations have always been a crucial part of European foreign policy. Even in a globalised world, in which some experts see the axis shifting from the west towards the powers of the east, I am still firmly convinced that the EU-US relationship is pivotal to stability, growth and prosperity, not only on both sides of the Atlantic, but throughout the world. We have strong roots in common; we share culture, lifestyles, outlooks and markets; and, most of all, we have always been the standard bearers for values, ideals and needs, whether ideological, economic or social, which have cast us in a leading role on the world stage. On account of the new global scenario and balance of power, however, I think we need to make our collaboration with Washington more operational, and for the EU to assert itself as a credible partner, it is vital to put across not just an image of cohesion but also the ability to take on concrete commitments.
costep_1999-04-14_5_16	Mr President, Commissioner, as I am speaking on this issue probably for the last time during the term of this Parliament, I shall not hide from you that I have a vague feeling of disquiet. I feel almost as if I am abandoning a child who has not yet fully recovered from an illness in the middle of the street and wondering who will take care of him from now on. Will the next Parliament, as I very much hope, contain two real heavyweights like Mr Böge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt to replace the two of them? Mrs Roth-Behrendt is not here, but I trust the term 'heavyweight' does not offend her. They are two heavyweights who have stood firm even when the issue in question was no longer quite so topical and it would have been easier to let it drop rather than carry on attending countless meetings. I am wondering about this because even though the two committees, the Committee of Inquiry and the Follow-up Committee, have provided answers to many of the queries we raised, there are still further questions which remain. For example, I wonder who will from now on bring the required pressure to bear on researchers and on the world of science, which still has to provide many answers to our queries. Furthermore, will controls and inspections continue in the United Kingdom, both on the epidemiological front and in the ports where some not entirely healthy foodstuffs may still be found? Even though the guide for consumers has been corrected and revised in the latest edition, I am wondering whether it will be adequate to help the target readership to understand what they should be doing. I would like to put one further question to the House and to the spectres who will fill it during the next parliamentary term. Who will still protect the consumers? Will others be as resolute as ourselves in defending their rights? The families affected by new variant Creutzfeld-Jacob’s disease have received some compensation, but we should not forget the dire prediction of one professor, who said, 'Take care, the incubation period lasts for 15 years!' So we should not let the matter drop in this respect either. Finally, the second bi-annual report states that almost everything has been done. Among the points missing is the follow-up to the Green Paper on food law. One more question, who will take the lead here? I wish them the best of luck!
costep_2000-12-13_4_37	Apart from its seeking to make an impact by setting out good intentions regarding stability, the rule of law and the fight against corruption, the Oostlander report is in fact nothing more than a vote of confidence in Mr Putin. This document says little or nothing about the disastrous implications of returning to the law of the market: poverty on a massive scale for the majority of the population, whose standard of living has been reduced by two thirds since before 1991. If it is right to denounce the Stalinist dictatorship of the past, how is it possible to have the slightest confidence in Mr Putin, the executioner of the Chechen people, the godfather of the various mafias and the man who endeavours to eliminate all opposition in civil society (unions, political parties) in order to strengthen his personal power? In this area, note should be taken of the rapporteur’s concern to help churches and religious organisations. However, there is absolute silence about the unions, now threatened by the reform of labour legislation and, in certain cases, by outright police repression. For these reasons, I have voted against this report. Baltas report A5-0364/2000
costep_2010-11-25_9_1	Mr President, I voted for this resolution on the ongoing negotiations on the 2011 budget. The failure of last week’s Parliament-Council Conciliation Committee meeting has caused significant concern throughout the European Union. It is regrettable that some do not yet feel they need to adhere to the Treaty of Lisbon. If we are unable to agree on the budget and other related issues by the end of the year, there will be very grave consequences. The creation of the European External Action Service and the three new institutions to monitor European Union financial institutions would be very difficult if there is a lack of funding. A shortage of money would also mean that cohesion policy, one of the most important policies in the European Union, would not be implemented properly, not to mention what would happen to the Europe 2020 strategy and the GALILEO programme. I therefore feel that the constructive and flexible position of the European Parliament demonstrates once again that, faced with the conditions of the financial crisis, the European Parliament really is acting responsibly.
costep_2001-02-14_12_15	Mr President, one of the objectives highlighted by the recent Tampere, Feira and Nice Summits, by resolutions of this Parliament and by the Euro-Mediterranean Forum, which we held in Brussels only last week, is the combating of the organised networks that traffic in immigrants. This is a despicable traffic, which causes so much harm and even tragedy amongst the immigrants themselves and great concern within the European Union, a concern sometimes greater than that seen in some of these immigrants' countries of origin, although it is a hard thing to say. We must therefore receive the two French initiatives with satisfaction. But the report by Mr Ceyhun suffers from a lack of legal rigour, which if not corrected will make it impossible to vote in favour - and believe me I am sorry - particularly on the point I am about to mention. I am personally acquainted with the magnificent work that some NGOs are doing in this field; the humanitarian care many of them are giving surpasses their own means. But from that to generalising that if an association performs the criminal action of providing organised aid for the entry, residence or movement of illegal immigrants it should be exempt from liability, is going too far. This is because profit or financial benefit, as for example happens in Spanish criminal law, is an aggravating circumstance but it is not the essential component in characterising the crime of trafficking in human beings. This does not mean that there are not aspects of the report that can be accepted and which I applaud, such as the compensation for the regions that most suffer from migratory pressure or prosecution of employers who use and abuse these workers illegally. Finally, in any case, I believe that in this battle against illegal immigration the cooperation of the countries of origin is absolutely necessary, since without it any attempt to combat these criminal networks is doomed to failure. The European Union alone cannot control this migration phenomenon if it cannot count on the essential collaboration of the countries from which the migration originates.
costep_2003-07-02_3_138	Mr President, Commissioner, to ensure that significant progress is made in Cancun on the realisation of the development agenda is not going to be easy, bearing in mind the need to reflect the interests of all the members of the WTO, to take up the concerns of the least-developed countries and in view of the great number of issues to be negotiated. All of these issues are essential to ensuring that multilateral trade relations lead to economic growth, if we want this growth to be equitable and its benefits also to reach the least-developed countries. Hence the need to make progress on all fronts in the development agenda and if possible within the time periods laid down, in line with the support you are providing on behalf of the European Union. In view of the brevity with which I am obliged to speak, I will restrict myself to access to the industrial product markets, in particular, naturally, the textiles and clothing sectors and to respect for the rules which govern international trade. In this regard, I would ask you, Commissioner, to ensure that there is no reduction in the European Union’s tariffs while other countries have not reached the tariff levels laid down in the Union. Secondly, that you pay special attention, within the framework of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, to the issue of designs and the international exhaustion of the registered trademark and to actions to combat counterfeiting and pirating. Finally, I would ask you to promote simplification of the commercial defence mechanisms in order to make them quicker and more effective, because the persistence of tariff barriers, tariff peaks and non-tariff barriers is incompatible with the process of liberalising the markets. Because the rules of the WTO are binding on all members and therefore compliance with them must be guaranteed. But also, because the future of the European textiles and clothing industry depends on it, as the Commissioner is well aware.
costep_2000-11-17_3_16	Following on from the special Council meeting in Tampere, the Portuguese Presidency tabled an initiative in June this year with a view to adopting a Council Decision on establishing a European Police College. We find the objectives of the proposal are excellent: to establish training programmes for senior officials and staff in the police forces of Member States, but also applicant countries, in all crime-fighting areas necessitating cross-border cooperation. We also think the method adopted for this initiative is perfectly appropriate: we are not going to set up a new European structure liable to be rather divorced from reality at the national level, but rather to create a College in the form of a network made up of the existing national training institutes for senior police officers. Each national unit would accommodate one section of the European Police College. In this way, the College would not be based in any one place, but would be present everywhere. Its governing board would be made up of all the directors of the national institutes, who would therefore have the benefit of full knowledge of the facts when determining their requirements. This arrangement would guarantee the College’s remaining permanently close to grass-roots developments, avoiding any divergence between the approach of the college and that of the national technical experts to actual problems. Moreover, it would be flexible in its organisation, offering great potential for development, with the possibility of training programmes being held at the best qualified national institute for each aspect. This is a good illustration of what we are starting to call 'Network Europe', a Europe which puts nations in contact with each other directly, without the need to maintain pointless superstructures. Unfortunately, this instrument, which we find perfectly satisfactory, does not seem to appeal greatly to the European Parliament. The amendments tabled by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are pushing in the opposite direction, emphasising that this is a temporary structure, that the time period for revision must be short, and that a permanent headquarters must be found for the organisation. At this rate, there is a great danger that, in a few years' time, we will find ourselves with a new costly superstructure that thinks itself superior to the national services, that does not cooperate well with them and ends up not being efficient enough. According to what I have been told, this is the route that Europol is going to go down if we do not soon take steps to change its course. In our opinion, the most effective way of working, for the European Police College, as for most of the other areas of cooperation, especially in the police, justice and security sector, is to establish networks between the existing national services.
costep_2002-05-30_4_48	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am honoured to present today, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, the second reading of Supplementary and Amending Budget No 2/2002. The Commission and the Council have suggested we should charge off as much as EUR 10.5 billion in outstanding payments in this SAB. This represents an enormous under-utilisation of available resources, which will be returned to Member State coffers in the form of reimbursements, even though the relevant expenditure commitments have not been cancelled. Moreover, the Commission has not prepared any plan to reabsorb unused payments from 2001, nor stated whether some of the unused appropriations from 2001 correspond to commitments from 2000, and which could consequently be reallocated to 2003 under the forfeiture clause, and whether it would thus be possible to release any appropriations that have been written off. In the first reading Parliament refused to accept this situation, and tabled amendments to provide a EUR 4.5 billion boost for programmes with the highest outstanding appropriations. The EU’s commitments must be honoured, and we cannot allow, now or in the future, transfers to thwart the proper implementation of the budget as approved by the financial authority. Following Parliament’s first reading, the Commission, although aware of the gravity of the situation, declared that it could not, at least for the moment, use the extra appropriations effectively or concretely. The Committee on Budgets took note of the declarations, showing a great sense of responsibility - partly because it wanted to strengthen appropriate cooperation with the Commission and the Council - and decided to take account of this situation. Accordingly, in an extraordinary meeting held yesterday, it decided not to endorse the budget amendments tabled in the first reading. Instead it called on the Commission to commit to presenting an assessment of the situation by 30 September next and to propose at that time any measures needed to address the total transfers and supplementary budget. The other institutions also need to emulate the sense of responsibility displayed by Parliament here today, since we cannot disguise the fact that there is now more than EUR 100 billion in outstanding commitments and that the Community budget needs to be managed more efficiently, consistently and transparently. In view of the above reasons and comments, I would ask you to vote for the SAB 2/2002 report as adopted by the Council and for the amendments to the draft resolution tabled by the Committee on Budgets.
costep_2000-03-14_3_17	Mr President, the report you have presented is ambitious and complex, and I will only touch on a few points. One: I cannot be other than content with your decision to start focusing on the Mediterranean, both because of the contribution to the Middle East peace process and because it will salvage and strengthen the historical and political ties which unite the countries of Southern Europe. We consider that, with the implementation of the geo-political processes, the Mediterranean border is just important as eastward enlargement, which both Parliament and the Commission are working on. Two: the internal market. Working in the European Parliament, we can see that harmonisation of the existing legislation on civil law is essential. In all probability, we ought to start work in the field of administrative law as well. Moreover, every day, we become more aware of the need for a common legal system coordinating the different legal systems of the Member States. Three: the preparatory documents. I can only add my voice to the requests to limit the use of preparatory documents, which are presented several times by several different people in the European Parliament. Despite the fact that they do, on the whole, make for a more in-depth debate, green papers, white papers and statements also have complex, problematic side-effects, as, more often than not, they prolong legislative action in matters in which timing is absolutely essential. Lastly: the Commission’s Work Programme seems to overlook two sectors which are in need of particular attention from the European institutions, especially in the light of the developments constantly taking place in e-commerce. I feel that the Commission should submit proposals on the out-of-court settlement of disputes over on-line contracts and on amendments to the Directive on distance contracts, in order to provide increasingly effective consumer protection.
costep_1999-03-10_14_5	Madam President, discussing tobacco is always very awkward, not so much because of the hour at which we have to do it, as because of the difficulty we MEPs have in understanding one another. This is where the main obstacles lie. As the representative of the Environment Committee said, there is a fundamental paradox here. It is true that smoking is unhealthy, but it is equally true that the problem will not be solved by reducing or eliminating tobacco growing in Europe. Either we take a radical position and have the courage to call for smoking to be banned, or else we try to cut the rhetoric. The arguments are always the same: on occasion, I have had to support tobacco growers and defend the sponsorship of major sporting events, including the Formula 1 Grand Prix, even though tobacco advertising has been banned at these, and certain Member States' governments have challenged the legality of the measures we are adopting. It was nevertheless decided to press ahead, without applying the principle of subsidiarity, bearing in mind that other sectors - such as textiles and clothing - had branding problems needing to be tackled gradually over time. We are told at one and the same time that production should be switched and that milk quotas cannot be increased, that under the COM in wine vineyards cannot be replanted or extended, and so on in all the other farm sectors. Let us call a spade a spade; let us not make impractical proposals. If we put forward workable ideas, with the necessary subsidies, then tobacco growers will be willing to go along with our initiatives - as long as they are feasible. Let us cut the rhetoric of the Environment Committee’s amendments. Let us support the Commission’s proposal as amended by Mr Trakatellis, remaining consistent with the realistic approach we adopted previously, granting aid for quality improvements with a view to promoting tobacco that is less harmful than before, and investigating tangible - not rhetorical - ways of embarking on a process of crop substitution.
costep_1997-06-25_2_2	Mr President, Friday’s Minutes correctly record my protest that the plenary did not discuss financial aid for Bulgaria and Macedonia. The President also told me that according to her information that was the decision of the Committee on External Economic Relations. Let me make it quite clear that the Committee on External Economic Relations unanimously decided the contrary! After all, this was an urgency, which we approved on Tuesday morning. The committee met on Tuesday evening in Strasbourg and decided unanimously that its chairman or a representative would present an oral report; and then suddenly, on Friday morning, we heard that there would not be a debate. I am absolutely in favour of accelerated procedures, but to find that an important political question, involving a lot of money, is not discussed either in committee or in plenary is quite contrary to parliamentary procedure and our Rules of Procedure!
costep_2000-07-05_4_48	Mr Jarzembowski feels that the European Union should do the impossible in order to complete the internal market in the railway sector by 2005, with a view to giving railway undertakings a chance to regain part of the road transport market. We can only welcome such an objective, which is doubly desirable, both from the economic and the ecological point of view. However, we are against total liberalisation of the railways in the form recommended. We do not want to have a single model imposed on us! Railway transport in France is a precious public service, a real tool for regional planning in the broad sense of the term, above all, from the rural point of view. The model of the French railways is also a factor in social cohesion. In fact, it is perfectly normal to maintain services to unprofitable stations by funding them from much more profitable stations. That is why, as a French member of the EDD Group, I feel it is important to defend the notion of a public service in this procedure. Furthermore, absolute and compulsory liberalisation of the railway infrastructure might hamper the development of the Community railways as a result, for example, of the instability and uncertainty which it would introduce into a market which needs a high level of technical expertise and investment both for the railway undertakings and the local authorities. To conclude, I would remind you that, as a Member for the EDD Group, I support maintaining employment and social cohesion, especially in rural areas, in order to safeguard activities. It is even more important to ensure that the public services provided in our villages do not disappear. If the railways are liberalised, we can kiss rural life goodbye, which is why we are opposed to this blind liberalisation and its consequences.
costep_2006-02-15_1_46	Mr President, it is estimated that Iran could have nuclear weapons within three to ten years, although the point of no return in stopping that development could be reached much sooner. Dealing with Iran has been made all the harder by the Iraq war, which was not just a disaster but could turn out to be an act of geopolitical folly. The Iranian regime cannot be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. It is a religious fundamentalist, barbaric, pro-terrorist and anti-Semitic regime. The world became used to the nuclear stand-off between the democratic west and the communist east during the Cold War, but in that confrontation, disaster was avoided because ultimately both sides were rational. The religious fundamentalists of Iran are not rational. An Iranian nuclear device could turn out to be the biggest suicide bomb the world has ever seen. In this situation all the options are dangerous but the most dangerous option is doing nothing at all.
costep_2002-05-30_4_5	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal to the Council of 25 July 2001 on State aid to the coal industry has a certain number of good qualities and one slight defect. The first of the good qualities is the fact that it is essential. The second is that it really is an important step in the right direction for the coal industry. The slight defect is that it contains a certain number of inaccuracies which have not been removed at the committee stage. This proposal is essential because the previous arrangements will expire in July 2002, hence the need for a new regulation. Above all, it is essential because of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, which is the legal basis of the previous arrangements governing aid to the coal industry. The restructuring of the coal industry in Europe has not been entirely completed, so there can be no question of not having a new regulation on these arrangements for State aid. This proposal is also a step in the right direction insofar as it makes provision for production aid to cease in 2007. In fact, I believe that it is inevitable and desirable to make provision for the cessation of this aid, since coal and steel products will be re-integrated into the common law of the Treaty on European Union following the expiry of the ECSC Treaty. My attention and the discussions in committee were concentrated on the revision, from my point of view, of this text, an important revision, because it consists of supporting the creation of what is known as an 'indigenous primary energy base' in order to preserve the European Union’s independence regarding this product. This creation is slightly surprising in a text which originally had only a technical purpose. In any case, it calls, and has called, for the following comments from me and from a certain number of other Members. Is Europe threatened if this indigenous primary energy base is not created? Is there any strategic interest in creating such a base? In other words, is coal strategic, and is indigenous coal production within certain limits strategic to the European Union? My reply to these two questions is negative. I believe, and the experts agree with me, that the world coal market is characterised by both great dispersion of supply and great stability of prices in the medium and long-term. The risk of shortages is quite small. In addition, there are a number of products which could claim strategic status, and therefore the replies obtained from the Commission have led me, I regret to say, to propose that this revision be stated separately in this text in order to deal with this problem. The period of validity of this regulation is set to end in 2010. I had proposed that it should end in 2007, for the sake of consistency, because that was the year, in the Commission proposal, for ending production aid. I regret to say that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy did not agree with me, and my report was rejected. That being the case, I invite you to vote for this report on the original version of the Commission proposal because, despite its uncertainties, inaccuracies and obscurities, the proposed regulation is a step in the right direction, towards support for the restructuring of the coal industry, albeit for a limited period of time. I believe that this is how that support should be given, because it cannot continue indefinitely.
costep_1998-09-17_8_30	Madam President, it is an incredible disgrace for this House that, due to the intransigence of some parliamentary groups, we were not in a position to adopt a text on Kosovo, and this in the dramatic situation of unutterable misery which currently exists there. In my opinion, we must in the near future concentrate vigorously on two points. The first is to demilitarise Kosovo and to replace the mercenaries and groups of soldiers marauding there with an international peacekeeping force, and the second is to put police, administration and jurisdiction back into the hands of the elected authorities in Kosovo. We should be able to reach agreement on this minimal programme. We should concentrate on this, and then we can avoid disgraces such as we have seen today.
costep_1997-09-15_10_4	Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Today we have another opportunity, after well over a year, to debate the postal services, and this time during the second reading of the guidelines with the interminable title. If we are to be honest, this guideline is no great leap forward. The only success one can acknowledge is that the guideline is temporary and thus - I say it quite openly - this puts a certain amount of pressure on Member States to make their postal services competitive and fit for the internal market. If this were not possible, the guideline would not be worth the paper it is printed on. We do not wish, however, to quarrel with the main planks of the compromise, agreed by the Telecommunications Council of Ministers last December, because I naturally see the following problems here: a) a majority decision, b) forcing the issue through in Council. A certain reserved sector is essential to ensure that basic postal coverage also applies to rural areas. A universal commitment to service - in other words a certain minimum range of postal products available to all citizens at acceptable prices - is equally justified. My group, the Group of the European People’s Party will not puss for a compromise procedure, as we must at long last come to the point where things start moving in the member states. The crucial issue is how we organize a common market in which the central European question, namely final accounting, has to be regulated by an antiquated system - the World Postal Union. No one has been able to give me a satisfactory answer to this question. It was quite astonishing how diplomatically Brian Simpson presented his report today, with little trace left of the combative and innovative spirit we saw in the first reading. A year ago we agreed that we had to find a European solution to the problem of final payment. Now, in the second reading, allegiance is withdrawn, just so as not to endanger the Council’s compromise. My compliments to the British on how quickly they have learned the rules of the game! We in the Group of the European People’s Party feel that we must achieve a common market, with competition even in the postal services, but that this competition should not grant one nation advantages over another. A reserved sector, a universal service obligation, which is attacked, even undermined, by unauthorised redirection can never meet with our approval. I am really touched by Mrs Schmidbauer’s crocodile tears, but if you want social protection and so on, support my amendment! Then things will proceed automatically, then we shall no longer have any need to discuss small post offices in Germany and the like. You have it in your power to do something tomorrow for your comrades! I had wanted to cover a few more things, but time has run away from me. Mr Commissioner, The matter of terminal dress has still not been settled. Even though, thanks to the dissension of the opposing side, we shall not win tomorrow, I must ask you to see that we make progress here. We cannot create an internal market with a World Postal Union!
costep_2011-06-08_7_14	Mr President, it is obviously very important that in the European Union, the same principles can be applied to all the Member States of the Union. In this respect, the Schengen Agreement is one step forward towards this kind of closer cooperation, that is to say, freer movement, but we must obviously remember that free movement also has to involve a certain sense of responsibility. Now we must hope that, when Romania and Bulgaria join the Schengen area, the problems that have occurred on their borders are actually addressed, and that adequate resources are channelled there to ensure that this sort of illegal migration and the other occurrences can be prevented. Of course, basically the situation is that there cannot be a two-tier system in the European Union: the same rules have to apply to everyone. In this way, we can also ensure that the same opportunities are pursued in these countries as elsewhere. Resources are needed, because we know the problems and dangers that are occurring there.
costep_2001-04-04_10_3	Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, first I should like to thank the rapporteur. He has seen this difficult dossier, which involved an extremely difficult fight in the Council, through two institutions and the Conciliation Committee, and that is most important. Rapporteurs simply need to have the courage to stand their ground. He has demonstrated that courage and has been successful as a result. I join him in thanking the French Presidency of the Council, which endeavoured to find a compromise at the eleventh hour. I should like to thank the Vice-President and her officials for helping us to negotiate that compromise. So, in this respect, my warmest thanks to the Commission. I, too, shall endeavour to be brief on this lovely evening, hence just three points. First: we had to set ports, inland ports, sea ports and intermodal terminals in the right context within a text on trans-European networks, which is why we said they must be ports and inland ports which are connected to the hinterland, which form part of a network, and not individual ports, which may be very nice but which have no trans-European significance. I think that the classification which we have found together with the Council is a very good one. Secondly, we had to draw a dividing line between infrastructure and superstructure. To non-specialists that all sounds very complicated, but it is fundamental to the question of equality of competition between ports or to the question of inadmissible distortions of competition. First, it was important to clarify what we mean by infrastructure. So what must the state do and pay, without intervention on the part of the Community, without any notification requirements? A typical question might be: does dredging a harbour mouth have to be notified or not? This gave rise to a whole series of difficulties between the Member States and the Commission. But what was important was to clarify that superstructure is defined by reverting to infrastructure, in order to ensure that there is no competition-distorting aid. I think this was achieved very well. And a third point, if I may. Madam Vice-President, please bear in mind that this is the first time that Parliament has been able to codecide on priority projects in the codecision procedure. Because the wise Heads of State or Government said after Essen and Dublin that they would decide what priority projects are! What is Parliament here for? In this case, we have managed, with the rapporteur’s help, to ensure that the Council and Parliament decide jointly on priority projects and we should bear this in mind when it comes to the revision.
costep_2009-12-15_15_13	Mr President, public access to documents means the right of citizens to participate in decision making and acquire information in order to do so. The Treaty of Lisbon endorses this fundamental right of EU citizens. If the European Parliament does not defend this fundamental right, who will? That is why it is very important that we adopt a strong and clear position in favour of transparency in this sitting. We should not accept any backward steps, or those the Commission is proposing. I can assure you that there are a lot of misconceptions going around concerning what we are deciding on here. We do not want to jeopardise international negotiations, but we think that citizens have a right to know what matters are being discussed with foreign powers that affect their rights. Neither do we conclude here that every Member of the European Parliament should make the contents of his or her e-mail public. If anyone is afraid of that, there is absolutely no need to be.
costep_1998-03-30_5_16	Madam President, I would like to voice my support for the call to reinstate the Herman report on the agenda. This report is important because it presents the grave and urgent problem of the weakness, or rather non-existence, of democratic control procedures for economic and monetary union in its broad sense, and not just for the European Central Bank, which is the subject of the Randzio-Plath report. The Herman report notably includes the excellent amendments by Mr Gallagher adopted by the Committee on Institutional Affairs which considered it unacceptable that democratic control could elude national parliaments without being replaced by an equivalent control at a European level. Clearly, we do not arrive at the same conclusions as Mr Herman, since we believe that it is impossible to organize control at a European level when there is no European state. So once more, this report is worthwhile since it poses a very urgent problem, according to the terms used in the 'avant-première' of the Parliamentary sitting, which is an official document of the European Parliament.
costep_2000-10-05_2_4	Mr President, I believe that both the rapporteur and Mrs Ferrer have highlighted the main points of Parliament’s position and the legislative procedure to date, and they have pointed out how the Council, Parliament and the Commission have worked together in order to arrive at a text that is correct and acceptable to everyone. I think that, once again, the conciliation procedure, which means agreement between the institutions, is working properly. However, there is an amendment that the Council rightly rejected. It is Amendment No 15, on fraud. A Customs Code is not the place for establishing rules on fraud. That is something that depends on the correct functioning of administration and, clearly, in a legislative debate we should not be discussing the subject of fraud. Taking advantage of the fact that the Commissioner responsible for the internal market, Mr Bolkestein, is here, I would like to point out that a few years ago the European Parliament established its first committee of inquiry, which was to investigate fraud in the transport of goods. There was a report by Mr Bouwman, an excellent report that we adopted, in which considerable fraud was revealed, for example, in the case of tobacco. There were goods, particularly tobacco, which were entering through a non-Community country in the European Economic Area zone, going through the Community zone and then mysteriously leaving the Community zone on paper, but without actually leaving. Currently, for example, there has been a drop in the price of bananas in the European Union. It seems that multinational companies are placing their excess bananas, those that they do not sell in the United States and Europe, in Eastern Europe. From Eastern Europe, certain 'charitable' organisations, that is mafias, introduce these bananas, which were practically given to them, into the Community market, competing with the prices of legal importers and Community producers. We could also mention the ongoing fraud in tomatoes, in which we see prices being continually undervalued because goods are being introduced through certain Community ports without authorisation. Therefore, while recognising, as the Council and the Commission have said, that this amendment was not appropriate in this case, I would like to, once again, take the opportunity to point out that the procedures for monitoring imports in the European Union are not working, that fraud is being committed and that this fraud is not only bad for Community taxpayers, but also for the functioning of the internal market, and even for loyalty to third countries. If we want third countries to accept commitments, the European Community must be the most zealous in ensuring that its own rules are being complied with, because if a country has the opportunity to place products in the Community by means of smuggling, why is it going to bother to negotiate with us for any sort of concessions? I therefore welcome the fact that we have reached an agreement on this subject. I think that the modifications are very positive, but I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission for greater vigilance and for stricter measures on fraud in Community customs.
costep_2009-04-01_16_19	Three years ago the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to the wives of political prisoners detained in Cuba in March 2003. These women in white fearlessly drew attention to human rights abuses in their country. The European Council has repeatedly adopted conclusions on continuing in open dialogue with the Cuban authorities, while at the same time insisting on compliance with fundamental human rights and freedoms. However, it has also taken the decision that these rights must always be raised during official visits, and whenever possible, meetings should be set up with the democratic opposition. I have to report that during the official visit of Mr Michel, the Commissioner for Development, no such meetings took place, despite the fact that a request was put forward. This is all the more incomprehensible and shocking due to the fact that the European Commission’s visit to Cuba took place on the date of the sixth anniversary of the arrest of the Castro regime opponents. It concerns me that the Vice-President of our Parliament was also a member of the delegation.
costep_1997-04-08_9_8	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the Council’s common position on the creation of a standard Community model for national driving licences. Firstly, this will contribute to facilitating the movement of persons within the Community; secondly, to increasing road safety and enhancing legal certainty and consumer protection; and, thirdly, to facilitating the establishment of residence in a Member State other than the one in which the driving licence was issued. In order to achieve these goals, it is necessary for all particulars - all additional information and restrictions that must be recorded in a driving licence - to be presented in a non-linguistic form. The proposed system of standard coding of both the notes on the conditions for driving a vehicle and the notes on the administrative procedures for the harmonization of driving licences will make driving licence endorsements easier to understand and simplify checks on national driving licences, which will continue to be valid. So far, so good. But I fail to understand one section of this House: how can you accept the continuation of national responsibility for issuing driving licences - even if on the basis of a standard Community model - and at the same time call for Community legislation on the suspension and withdrawal of licences? Clearly, double standards are being used here. Surely matters of justice and internal security are still aspects of the Union’s third pillar, and therefore subject to intergovernmental cooperation? I can only recommend the rejection of these amendments, which are in breach of existing Community law and which, I am sorry to say, were adopted by a majority in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. I should like to thank the Council for its common position, in which it takes over the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading and accepted by the Commission.
costep_2004-10-27_1_61	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it turns out that Mr Barroso needed to be given a fright in order to resign himself to withdrawing his Commission. It is a victory for European democracy and a great encouragement to all those who helped create the conditions for this decision. I would point out that when, under the pretext that it was criticising his team, the President-designate accused half of this House of siding with, and I quote, ‘the anti-European extremists’, he yesterday revealed himself once more to be precisely the person he not long ago maintained he did not want to be: a President of the Right in conflict with the Left and, indeed, the liberals. The Commission did not believe that we could agree upon a common position, but we succeeded and we won. Now, the next stage has to be prepared and, with that in view, lessons learned from what has just happened. How did such an unprecedented situation arise? Yesterday, I drew attention to the disaffection felt by the majority of people and to some of the symptoms of the evil that is eating away at our institutions. In this context, the challenge to be taken up by European leaders at all levels was, and remains, that of daring to carry out a critical evaluation of what is now lacking and of showing that they are determined to invest the European adventure with meaning again, for, contrary to what you said, Mr Barroso, I, for my part, believe in Europe. I am convinced of the need for Europe, so do not go on classifying me among the anti-Europeans. Mr Barroso did the opposite of taking up this challenge. Not only did he accentuate the most controversial features of European economic and social policy by placing champions of liberalism in strategic posts, but he also fuelled fears of a return to the moral and patriarchal order of times gone by and of people uniting behind a vision of the world closer to that of American neo-conservatives than to the expectations of Europeans. That is what, in our view, must change in the future Commission, not just the identity of the person responsible for a particular portfolio. In this troubled context, I shall single out one very good piece of news. Others have said it before me: what we have here are fresh stirrings of political confrontation in the European Parliament, finally replacing half-heartedness and feeble consensus. A real debate about the civilised order has begun that may have far-reaching consequences for the greater good of Europe. In this sense, these historic moments constitute a genuine milestone. May their promise be fulfilled!
costep_2005-02-22_1_136	Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mr Florenz, Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for having initiated this debate on Natura 2000. In comparison to other European countries, Poland can boast of significant achievements in the field of environmental protection. The designation of protected areas is a Polish tradition that goes back to the 19th century, with such areas now covering 32% of the country, up from 9% just 20 years ago. Yet Poland is concerned at the fact that whilst the concept of the Natura 2000 network in Europe has evolved, this has not been backed up by an appropriate guarantee of funding for the creation and maintenance of this network. The country has therefore put its name to the declaration submitted by a majority of EU Member States in October and December, in which they express their disappointment at the European Commission’s proposal concerning the cofinancing of the Natura 2000 network. No clear details are provided regarding the principles according to which funding can be obtained for protection measures for Natura 2000 sites between 2007 and 2013, and this will undoubtedly mean shortfalls in funding for the Natura 2000 network. It will then be impossible to implement many much-needed protection measures. The majority of areas designated as Natura 2000 sites in Poland will not be covered by the funds indicated, for example, land that is part of national forests, or swamps, natural grasslands, dunes, moorlands and scrublands that are not used for agricultural purposes. In the context of the European Commission’s letter of 6 January 2005 to Poland, which suggested that consideration be given to the possibility of extending the list of Natura 2000 sites in the country, a guarantee of separate funding for the establishment of the Natura 2000 network has taken on even greater significance for Poland and other countries. Poland therefore expects that in the course of work on the new Financial Perspective, appropriate levels of funding will be safeguarded for the establishment of the Natura 2000 network. I would suggest that the LIFE+ Regulation also contains separate provisions for LIFE+ and for Natura 2000.
costep_2001-05-16_7_21	Mr President, it is unacceptable to give the impression that minority parliamentary groups and the smallest groups in this Parliament, which have taken the initiative of proposing that we reject this report, have done so in order to conceal the funding of European political parties, or those that claim to be such. This is simply an attempt, by the large groups in this Parliament, to cover up a decision by the European Court of Justice, which enabled them to benefit from funds to finance 'European political parties', which are not 'parties' since they do not use universal suffrage, which are 'political' in name only, since they are only concerned about financing the activities of parliamentary groups, and finally, which are only 'European' because they are not African or Asian. We would be creating a monster. Until my view can be disproved, the funding of European political parties can only be justified, even after the Treaty of Nice, once it accepts the practice of universal suffrage, which is the only acceptable definition of a political party.
costep_2006-11-15_8_37	The Services Directive has just been adopted, by a clear majority. This is to the European Parliament’s credit. This is a victory for the European Union. Why? Services represent over half of the European economy, and are the main source of jobs. The free provision of services features among the founding principles of the Union, and the creation of a genuine internal market in services is key to economic growth in Europe, and thus to the creation of jobs. The text adopted today in Strasbourg commits us to this path, while providing the necessary guarantees regarding the safeguarding of public services of general interest and the continuity of our social acquis and of our labour law. By excluding the country of origin principle, it prohibits social competition and constitutes an effective barrier to social dumping. It does away with the unjustified protectionist obstacles, while permitting the Member States to apply their national rules when the public interest warrants it. The scope of the text has also been reduced, with the exclusion of sensitive sectors such as the audiovisual sector, the health sector, part of the social services sector, the gambling sector and even the notary sector. This is a good compromise, which will take Europe forward in line with the interests of its population.
costep_2002-09-24_2_144	Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, the European Union’s information service has all too often seemed like propaganda passed down to the masses from above. The language of communication is also often cumbersome and not enough attention is paid to cultural differences. However, now it would appear that there is hope for better things to come. In the plans drafted under the guidance of Commissioner Vitorino we can read of the aim to base communications on the public’s need for information. That is how it should be too. The Commission’s four priorities concerning information - enlargement, the future of the Union, establishing the area of freedom, security and justice, and the EU’s role in the world, are absolutely crucial. That is why it is unthinkable that the Council should make cuts in its own draft budget in the area of appropriations for the information service. The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which supports Commissioner Vitorino’s information policy, has unanimously proposed there should be additional resources for the budget headings concerned with information. The social democrats in the Committee on Budgets adhere to the same policy. We cannot ask the people to become interested in our work if they do not know what is going on here.
costep_2009-02-19_10_204	Madam President, I support the report by Mrs Dahl and I am in favour, quoting Article 1 of the Publications Office of the European Union, of it being 'an interinstitutional office with the task of publishing the publications of the institutions of the European Communities and the European Union under optimum conditions'. I agree with the call by Mrs Dahl to European institutions to alter the legal bases for interinstitutional bodies in such a way as to permit a clear allocation of administrative and political responsibilities, since at the moment it is difficult to identify these. I believe that the use of information is the main way to bring the European Union closer to its citizens and, in this context, multilingualism must be the key instrument in putting into practice the aims of the Publications Office through the simultaneous publication of the Official Journal in all the European Union official languages, so as to ensure that it is clearly understood by everyone. This principle ought to extend to all the activities carried out by the Publications Office.
costep_2000-10-02_4_2	Madam President, I am not going to repeat everything we said earlier. I shall simply refer to your statement, for the reasons you, yourself, clearly outlined. I think that it would be appropriate at this time for Parliament to express an opinion on this situation which is characterised by what you, yourself, rightly termed the initial 'provocation' and also by this military repression, of a quite unheard of violence, which has already led to the deaths of about 40 people, including children, in conditions which each of us has been able to observe on the television. Today, then, anything could happen, the hopes of a lasting peace are in danger of being dashed, and so an initiative from Parliament is urgently needed. I, in fact, initially proposed - and I continue to support this proposal in principle - that we interrupt our debate on enlargement, tomorrow, between 5 and 6 p.m., in order to take advantage of Mr Moscovici’s attendance on behalf of the Council, as he could make a statement which would be followed by a debate and a vote. If, after consultation, the various groups see this option as presenting major drawbacks, despite my personal preference for this alternative, then there are two other possibilities, either Thursday morning when Mrs Péry is present or even Thursday afternoon when Mr Solana is present. The most important thing, in my view, is that Parliament should be able to express its opinion, that we should hear what the Council has to say, and that we should be able to continue to be involved in the Middle East peace process. All other aspects are secondary.
costep_2010-11-11_9_126	Given that the two partners are committed to cooperating in order to promote growth and jobs in their economies, and that Parliament is continuing to advocate the completion of a transatlantic market by 2015, based on the principle of a social market economy, alongside the completion of the EU’s own single market, this will be a key element in newfound growth and global economic recovery. I voted in favour of the resolution as I agree that the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) is the most suitable mechanism to manage the transatlantic economic relationship, and that the partners should make the most of the TEC to overcome existing barriers to economic integration and achieve a transatlantic market by 2015, based on the principle of a social market economy, which will act as a positive response to the current economic and social crises. I also agree with the call for cooperation within the TEC on all matters affecting the regulatory environment for industries, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), following the approach of the EU 'Small Business Act' when considering legislation with a transatlantic impact.
costep_1999-11-16_10_31	I thank you, Commissioner, for your response. But her response does not answer my questions. I asked her whether, if it appears that a large number of Member States do not or cannot yet meet the objective of the directive on account of large discrepancies in nitrate sources, both animal and artificial, should a different approach then not be opted for? I have not received a reply to this question. Neither have I received a response to my question regarding infringement proceedings. If it appears that out of the fifteen Member States, there are at least nine in respect of which infringement proceedings have been initiated and if the Commissioner presses for the implementation of the directive, what do we do then? Do we then enforce the legal instrument, is this what you want? Or would you withdraw this? Or would you just continue pressing for it? I would greatly appreciate it if I could have a clear answer to all these questions, as they have been submitted in writing, in addition to these supplements.
costep_2007-01-17_11_16	Thank you very much, Mr President, I also wish to congratulate you on your election and wish you all the best in your new post. The liberalisation of rail transport is something that needs to be brought about, but progress has been painstaking. We must therefore keep up the effort to move ever closer to a European rail services market, which will help us implement the important objectives of the common transport policy. In this regard, I should like to congratulate our rapporteurs on their outstanding work. Although, for many, trains still have an image of romanticism and adventure derived partly from the famous Orient Express, the fact is that they are a safe, environmentally friendly means of transport that is adept at moving large quantities of goods quickly and at conveying large numbers of people comfortably and equally quickly. The dream of rail services from the Atlantic to the Baltic and Black Seas remains a distant one, as we continue to come up against major obstacles to effective freedom of movement in the rail sector. The problem remains of discrepancies between, for example, gauges inside and outside the Iberian Peninsula, as do those of the management of internal and international traffic and of ticketing, which are not easy matters to resolve. We face enormous difficulties and, without the will of the Member States, we will not be able to overcome them. Congestion in Central Europe and the accessibility of Europe’s outlying regions are intimately linked. If we want to see the economic growth of our countries, joint measures are required whereby development in one area ties in with progress in another. The funding approved for the Trans-European Networks does not fill us with overwhelming enthusiasm. We must therefore derive some satisfaction from the progress for which we shall hopefully vote tomorrow. In its diversity, Parliament is doing its best, but the Council must respond positively to this impetus for progress and for the liberalisation of rail transport. How can this be achieved? It can be achieved by acknowledging that the deadlines for opening up the networks are reasonable and by not imposing unfair economic restrictions on this process; by accepting compromise solutions for existing concessions and for public service obligations; by agreeing to the rules on the certification of onboard staff in the interests of the security of people and property; and lastly by ensuring universal protection for the rights of all passengers. Along with quality of service, this is the best way of attracting people to this means of transport, thereby ensuring its development and continued employment for those working in the sector.
costep_2008-05-08_9_71	I voted in favour of the report by Mr Ford on trade and economic relations with ASEAN (the Association of the South East Asian Nations). I should like to emphasise that for it to bear fruit, an agreement requires the commitment of both partners. In the light of reports on recent negotiating rounds, the prospects for an early and ambitious agreement with ASEAN may be undermined by a lack of negotiating capacity and difficulties in developing a common position. ASEAN would be the EU’s fifth most important trading partner. The report supports the concept of a free trade agreement with ASEAN provided that the agreement meets certain key conditions. It is important to ensure that consumer protection is not curtailed or environmental protection reduced. Negotiating an agreement with a region composed of 10 independent countries is very complicated and time-consuming. At the same time, interregional agreements do offer significant gains because they promote regional integration, which strengthens partner countries' economies and reduces the number of regulations.
costep_2010-03-10_8_45	Mr President, I thank my colleague, Mr Albertini, for the excellent work he has carried out on this central theme in European politics. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union has shouldered greater responsibility for foreign affairs and common security policies, and I believe that many of us here hope that the institution to which we belong will take on greater responsibility and become more involved in foreign affairs. I especially agree that the High Representative of the CFSP should consult the European Parliament committee responsible when making appointments to managerial posts within the European External Action Service, which is currently being created, and that she should ensure that the European Parliament, as well as the Council, have access to confidential information. I therefore believe that the corner we have turned with this report is a first, important step towards creating a strong European foreign policy, determined to assert its own role and its own political weight on the international scene.
costep_2004-01-15_1_27	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the original purpose of this directive was to simplify matters, to ensure as part of the ‘SLIM’ programme that the number of European legal texts should be reduced as far as possible and that they should be made easier for the citizen to understand. I have massive doubts as to whether we have really succeeded with this proposal for a directive. As we all know, the European Union has for decades had workable sectoral directives for a whole series of skilled occupations, which were developed specifically to create suitable conditions for recognition in those occupations. If we are now approaching them on the principle that they should all be lumped together and there should be one directive applying as much to master carpenters as to medical consultants and surgeons, then I am convinced that nothing sensible can come of it in the end. That is why the majority of my group wanted to keep the sectoral directives. The fact is that most of the complaints received were not about the regulated areas but about those areas that were not regulated, that is to say, the areas not covered by the sectoral directives. We were unable to get the Committee to accept this view. The result now is obviously that there will have to be a large number of amendments taking more and more elements from the sectoral directives into the general directive. The outcome cannot be described as something that has produced a simplification of legislation in Europe, quite the opposite, it has all become more bureaucratic, more complicated, harder to understand and more inefficient, the opposite of ‘slim’, I would call the directive ‘thick’, to borrow the English word. Not to mention that I do not of course believe it is a good way of legislating to adopt a directive on medical consultants that is then not even implemented in the Member States but rescinded again and finally incorporated into this directive. In short, the consultations were in the end about preventing something worse rather than achieving something good. What the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has come up with has prevented something worse, but it has not done any good. We will vote in favour of this outcome given that nothing else could be achieved.
costep_1999-10-06_7_7	Mr President, on behalf of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I would like to welcome Madam President-in-Office of the Council and Mrs Wallström, of the Commission. Parliament must give you both its fullest support in your aim to include the issue of climate change in all European Union policy. We know that very far-reaching decisions will be made at the Helsinki Summit on how to take account of environmental considerations generally, and climatic issues in particular. Mrs Wallström spoke of a very positive matter with regard to Mr Monti. The Member of the Commission responsible for issues of competition is thus ready to look into how subsidies and taxes will impact on climatic issues. Parliament’s draft statement forcefully emphasises the importance of reducing those very large subsidies that are granted at present for fossil fuels. I believe that Mr Monti will tackle this problem in earnest. Perhaps we could then redirect the subsidies to areas that further the Union’s intentions, especially that of sustainable development. I also support the idea that we must try hard to ensure that market forces work to halt the development of climate change. In this, the importance of an energy tax cannot be underestimated. The Commissioner responsible for the Internal Market, Mr Bolkestein, told Parliament yesterday that he also intends to become involved in this issue, although, unfortunately, he said he still needed a year to convince Spain that an energy tax is really needed. I would have been interested to hear the opinions of the Member of the Commission and the President-in-Office on how a common energy tax would evolve, as, without one, the European Union will be unable to fulfil its objectives.
costep_2010-02-10_10_281	I voted in favour of adopting Turkey’s progress report 2009. Although accession negotiations with Turkey started on 3 October 2005, they have made very little progress up until now. The European Parliament feels that Turkey is still not meeting the Copenhagen political criteria. Far-reaching constitutional reform is required to ensure greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The European Commission noted that during 2009, Turkey made some progress, albeit limited, on political reforms. The situation in Turkey has improved in terms of freedom of expression in minorities' languages. I believe that the European Union must continue dialogue with Turkey and show openness to this country. Turkey is extremely important to Europe, both from the perspective of economic and political ties and for the European Union’s energy security. My country wishes to develop the partnership with Turkey as part of both the Black Sea Synergy and the European Union’s neighbourhood programmes.
costep_2006-12-11_14_24	Mr President, this decisive vote on the REACH regulation is taking place in December, when many parts of Europe are longing for snow and concern is being expressed about the current high temperatures. It is high time for us to take more measures aimed at protecting the environment and human health. The hard-fought compromise on REACH is a major step in that direction. Many concessions had to be made and many contradictory interests reconciled in order to attain it. For example, the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises had to be reconciled with those of large industrial concerns and the interests of poorer countries with those of richer ones. In addition, the interests of ardent defenders of the environment had to be reconciled with those of supporters of a more aggressive economy. It is worth noting that this debate is being held and this important regulation adopted in an enlarged Union including ten new countries.
costep_1997-06-12_7_12	Mr President, Mrs Pack not only organized an excellent hearing on the subject of sport, but she has also produced an excellent report for us to discuss today. If the Council of Ministers and the Members of the Commission are really serious about creating the people’s Europe that they are always talking about, then they should act on the recommendations contained in Mrs Pack’s report as soon as possible. The fact is that sport affects every aspect of people’s lives: culture, health, recreation, nutrition, integration, minorities and education. In education, however, sport has generally fallen victim to the need for cutbacks in recent times and has disappeared from the curriculum. What do we want? We actually want two things. Firstly, legitimacy, in other words a legal basis produced by including sport in the Treaty. And, secondly, an adequate budget for funding the most important aspects of Europe’s approach to sport. Finally, we need to show that Parliament too takes sport seriously. I was glad to hear that all my colleagues are in favour of Mrs Pack’s proposal, and I therefore hope that the Bureau will accede to the request it is shortly to receive for the name of the committee of which I am chairman to be changed to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.
costep_2002-03-12_2_33	Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism believes that Parliament, as the budgetary authority, must be regularly informed about the execution underway for structural actions so that the alarm can be raised in terms of the application of the sunset clause. With regard to the application of the additionality principle, which is an extremely important issue, the Commission must establish the means for its verification and control on the ground. Halfway through the period of application of the funds, the Commission should inform Parliament about the evaluation of its compliance on the basis of objective criteria. Furthermore, we ask the Commission, by means of appropriate solutions, to support the idea that the structural allocation should be considered a spending objective. In relation to the budget line for the trans-European transport network we note that the level of budgetary implementation over recent years is satisfactory and we recommend giving priority to projects with a clear European added value, stressing the importance of the funding of projects which provide a rebalance between modes of transport. We in the European Parliament also urge the Member States to use the Structural Funds while paying more attention to transport infrastructures, in particular intermodal transport and less polluting forms of transport. Naturally, in the case of land transport, they must pay particular attention to the railways, from the point of view of respect for the environment. Commissioner, at this decisive point for the European Union, prior to enlargement, the Member States, with the support of the Commission, will have to achieve greater efficiency in the application of the Structural Funds with the cooperation of the regions and local groups they are destined for. Only in this way will we come closer to the economic and social cohesion which, together with political union, is the great objective of the European institutions and citizens.
costep_1999-12-14_3_10	Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, my group would first like to acknowledge to those representing the Finnish Presidency that you, as compared with the European Parliament, have improved transparency and the flow of information. The Finnish Presidency has kept us better informed than former presidencies, which is obviously important, as it strengthens relations between the European Parliament and the Council with reference to the Treaty of Amsterdam. The conclusions of the Summit meeting declare, quite satisfactorily, that the Commission at last intends to issue a proposal in January regarding the conditions on which the public will be able to access the documents of the institutions. I would like to tell you that this draft regulation has been leaked to the public, and that is worrying. That does not make for a spirit of transparency; on the contrary, it might even weaken it, so I would ask you to give this matter your attention. The final proposal can surely yet be amended in such a way that it would really increase transparency. Regarding enlargement, I wish to say that we are very satisfied that the Council has now finally agreed that each candidate country must be assessed on their own merits. This is exactly the strategy we proposed from the outset. Now we have to ensure that we also achieve a balance in the progress we make in negotiations and that candidate countries give sufficient consideration to the issues of social security, equality between men and women, employment and environmental protection. With regard to Turkey, our opinion is that the European Council should mean what it says, in other words, that the same criteria should apply to Turkey as with the other countries that have been accorded candidate status. We call on you to look seriously into the question relating to the status of the Kurds. Islam is obviously already a European tradition, and so we have no fears of the European Union becoming more religiously diverse. We were not inclined to agree with those in the European Parliament who have been keen to narrowly define the borders of Europe in the belief that Islam is somehow non-European. On the contrary, we think it can indeed be a part of European culture. Th majority of our group would seem to agree that the European Union should also develop a system for military crisis management, to prevent humanitarian catastrophes. We are very dissatisfied with the way in which the European Council and preparatory discussions have paid little heed to public debate and public opinion. We want to point out that foreign and security policy, as any other, must be democratic, and you must open up this debate, so the public know what the next phases of the process are to be. We do not want the European Union to become NATO’s European military pillar. We want you to strengthen civil crisis management, because, as we all know, it is the wisest thing to do. The non-military prevention of conflicts is always more important, and for every euro invested in military crisis management at least as much must be spent on civil crisis management. Finally, your position on Chechnya was a step in the right direction. I am certain the European Parliament’s calls to put economic cooperation on ice have had an effect, and we believe that you will remain firm in your opinion that this is not a situation in which we can act as if nothing has happened.
costep_2003-01-16_4_15	Mr President, Commissioner, President of the EBRD, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, allow me to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur on his careful analysis of the EBRD’s activities. The choice of economic activities must combine the local dimension with the international and requires a supply of credit not only to encourage the emergence of initiatives that are well established within a country but also to help them spread to other markets. It is certainly the job of the EBRD to do this, but it is even more important to try to do it in countries with little industrial development, which have a greater need for support and revitalisation. If, in order to achieve this objective, it needs to take risks and, in some cases, accept unexpected losses, it must not then cut out initiatives and planned investments but rather benefit from new experiences so that it can manage lending more attentively and read the risks more carefully. This bank takes an ethical approach to credit management. Its institutional commitment is to invest in any country that is inspired by democratic principles and determined to promote a market economy. The first time, the bank asks clients for valid projects, with current market prices; it also requires that there should be no conflicts of interest or dominant positions in the operational area to be financed, and that the interests of the local community should always be respected. In the public sector, the EBRD calls for the greatest transparency to be employed in order to ensure competition and equal treatment for the market players. We welcome and support the rapporteur’s views when he urges the EBRD to support small local banks, which, in turn, should focus on small-scale lending. At this point, Mr President, allow me to sound an alarm: small bank lending is disappearing or is being considerably cut back. This is a matter for concern, because no economic or financial manoeuvre, however good it may be, could replace the support that small banks have always offered to small and medium-sized enterprises. We must also note that small-scale lending in many Member States and particularly the accession states is being thoroughly neglected; that leads to a daily increase in financial exclusion, which is the existence of serious gaps in the supply of small-scale credit services in the countries with the weakest economies, where a form of discrimination based on geographical criteria arises: red-lining. It is up to the EBRD, which has already chosen to operate in countries such as Albania, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Moldova, to help to integrate these disadvantaged economies fully into the international economic order.
costep_2006-12-13_10_81	The proposal on which we voted today provides for a review of the current emissions limits of motor vehicles and the inclusion of vehicles that run on biofuels. New technologies and scientific discoveries have enabled us to aspire to a high level of environmental protection and to invest in these new areas of the car market. In this day and age we cannot overlook the environmental challenges facing us, nor can we ignore the fact that there is a new market developing in the area of clean fuels. Consequently, the provision of information to the consumer on less polluting vehicles, on car repairs and on the new items that manufacturers are placing on the market are important measures for protecting and investing in the society of the future. Once again, the functioning of the internal market, the promotion of environmentally sustainable development and the improvement in the citizens' living conditions are coming under threat. I therefore voted in favour of the Groote report.
costep_1998-11-16_7_6	Mr President, we feel that the Commission’s proposal is sound and one we can accept and support. Nevertheless, quite a number of amendments were tabled in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, where all the political groups worked closely together. I support my colleague Mr Needle’s statement, which proves that the work in committee was fruitful and that we come to the House with a widely accepted position. Nevertheless, too many amendments were adopted in committee, as has tended to be the case of late. Some of these amendments are not entirely appropriate and it does not seem very likely that they could be incorporated into a coherent text. That is why we need to repeat Amendment No 31, which does not change what was adopted in committee but makes it easier to understand and enhances the legal certainty of the wording. I also believe it is important to repeat here in the House and for the benefit of the sector and the patients themselves, that the work would be facilitated and the trials harmonised with a fairly efficient system. Its key features are the mere notification of the start of the clinical trial, a time limit of 30 days and a single ethics committee. Speed and legal certainty will be gained. Finally, there will be adequate safeguards for the fundamental rights of individuals, which has been one of our main concerns since the beginning. In addition, the proposal will result in a text that is in line with international regulations, which was another of the goals we set ourselves.
costep_2004-04-01_1_118	Here it is at last - the long-awaited proposal for a decision establishing Regional Advisory Councils (RACs), which is a response to the framework regulation that provides for new ways of participating in the common fisheries policyWhile it is certainly a response, it also raises further questions. The rapporteur rightly points out that without adequate and continued funding this initiative will quickly become an empty shell, which will have helped the Commission to ease its conscience for the minimum outlay. My contribution to the report consists of requesting the creation of intermediate structures corresponding to coherent and homogenous geographical sub-units, whose role will be to propose technical recommendations to the RACs at the outset of the decision-making process. The social and economic dimension of the CFP will finally be taken into account, provided, again, that adequate funding is made available. The effectiveness of the RACs will depend entirely on the extent to which the fishery sector participates, which it will do in a genuine and effective way only if the RACs are guaranteed a certain level of Community funding and of involvement. The RACs can then take on a genuinely hands-on managerial role in addressing the economic, social and environmental issues directly affected by the CFP.
costep_1999-07-22_3_19	I could only approve with reservations the resolution of the European Parliament regarding the European Council Summit, held in Cologne on 3 and 4 June 1999 under the German Presidency. Those who had hoped that the success of the German Presidency would continue smoothly through this year would have been bitterly disappointed. There is a big difference between someone like Helmut Kohl shaping policies in the German and, at the same time, the European interest, coming to an agreement in advance with partners in the Member States, and thereby achieving something tangible as a result, and someone like Mr Schröder attempting to do this. The entire world has noticed that he is uneasy on the international stage. This has been evident in the lack of progress in the fight against the predominant problem in Europe, the lack of jobs and the inadequate employment situation. Back in 1994, with a German as EU President-in-Office of the Council, Helmut Kohl, a milestone was reached in Essen when agreement was reached on the first elements of a co-ordinated European employment strategy. On this basis, the Employment Summit in Luxembourg agreed upon significant guidelines. Jean-Claude Juncker demonstrated the path to changing the structure of the labour market with the aim of securing a higher employment level through increased efficiency. The grandiose announcement by Mr Schröder concerning the European Employment Pact was, as usual, premature. A lavish menu was planned but what transpired was meagre fare. All the' Cologne process' means is getting macro economic dialogue under way, i.e. conducting negotiations between the Council, Commission, social partners and the European Central Bank. Nothing more was achieved. This takes you back, embarrassingly, to the 'Alliance for Work', which has transformed into an 'Alliance for Rhetoric', lacking in effective structural reforms worthy of the name and where agreement cannot be reached on low wages, wage policy and wealth creation. Citizens, and primarily those who are unemployed, are sick and tired of rituals lacking in substance. Recently, the Kosovo conflict has overshadowed everything, but nothing can be concealed for long. With bombastic Schröder maxims, the Federal Government going it alone, unauthorised and arbitrary personnel decisions à la Hombach and through rough behaviour instead of sensitivity, there has been absolutely nothing to write home about, either at a national or at a European level. The European elections gave the necessary resounding slap in the face: The outgoing Council Presidency was a flop, not a success. Kosovo
costep_2003-01-15_3_183	Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have not answered my questions on the maritime areas located between the Canaries, Madeira, the Azores and the European Union. 70 000 ships pass through these areas, many of them large oil tankers, real monsters, of 100 000, 200 000 or more tonnes, and at any time an accident involving one of these oil tankers could lead to the economic ruin of many of these islands which are dedicated exclusively to tourism. You will understand better if we imagine this in the context of your own country. Imagine the results of an accident in the Aegean, or an accident in the Eastern Mediterranean, even outside the territorial waters of Greece. What would be the consequences for your islands? Do you not believe, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the European Union must adopt rules to regulate the maritime areas which endanger its coasts? The United States and Canada have done so, outside their own territorial waters, and I believe that the European Union would have the power to do so.
costep_2008-04-10_12_7	Mr President, the European Union must speak with one voice on such important matters as freedom, democracy and human rights. That was why it was so necessary to adopt an unequivocal stance regarding the situation in Tibet and to take decisive measures aimed at persuading China to respect those values. It is our moral duty to remind China of the promises it made to global public opinion on the subject of human rights when it was seeking to organise the Olympic Games. To date, China has failed to keep any of those promises. China is now an economic power that cannot be disregarded. It is very wrong, however, for politicians to give priority to achieving specific economic aims and favourable trade agreements over the protection of fundamental values. We must put an end to the policy of separating economic issues from human rights in our dealings with China. This need not, however, mean being sidelined economically. Indeed, the opposite is the case. China must be persuaded to commit to international standards and to respect them.
costep_2002-04-08_1_76	Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Di Lello Finuoli and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on their excellent work on uniting efforts to create instruments that will enable us to combat the increasing volume and the frequent cross-border effects of crimes against the environment. I must also highlight a recent survey published by Eurobarometer, which confirms that the environment, together with security, health and unemployment, is one of the main issues of concern to the citizens of the European Union. We therefore have an obligation to help to find solutions that can respond to these concerns and that can guarantee the protection of the environment and of our citizens' health, in an attempt to improve the quality of everyone’s life. We have, on the one hand, an initiative presented by Denmark in 2000 with a view to adopting a Council framework decision on combating serious crimes against the environment, which proposes that Member States adopt joint measures to protect the environment under criminal law, including effective investigations and prosecutions, and effective cooperation in police, criminal and administrative matters, in other words to establish an acquis in the field of criminal sanctions against environmental crimes. On the other hand, we have a Commission initiative from 2001 with a view to producing a directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law on the basis of Article 175 of the EC Treaty. This proposal is intended to apply to activities that breach Community legislation on environmental protection and/or rules adopted by Member States to complement such legislation. We must commend the strategy pursued by both the rapporteurs, Mr Di Lello Finuoli and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, of attempting to make the two reports as consistent as possible, thereby enabling the European Parliament’s position on the two initiatives to be clear and coherent. They both seek to give a clear indication of Parliament’s unequivocal preference for the Commission’s approach, in other words, for the adoption of a first-pillar instrument, because legislating on environmental matters falls within Community competence. It would be appropriate at this point, however, to point out that criminal law is not the exclusive responsibility of the European Union. By this I mean that the issue here is that the current system of sanctions is not sufficient to guarantee compliance with Community law, and this being the case, it is crucial that minimum rules are guaranteed, requiring the existence of effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, with the adoption of more rigorous rules and sanctions in this field nevertheless remaining at the discretion of the Member States.
costep_1999-01-27_12_4	Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Mann for his report. I think he has made a good attempt to focus attention on a number of new sectors in which jobs can be created. He mentioned small businesses. He also mentioned the need to learn. 'Learn, learn, learn' is the title I would like to give his report, because we can only create enough jobs if we have a population capable of meeting the challenge of the new technologies. I think that is a most important point to make, and his report makes it. We in the PPE Group of course support this report most warmly, but it is naturally something of a compromise. I think Mrs Weiler is right in calling it a mosaic. I have to say that some of the pieces added to the mosaic are worth rather less than others. The bits added by the rapporteur himself are rather better than those put in later, and that is a danger. When I was learning German, I had a little book entitled Schwere Wörter - difficult words -the differences between German and Dutch. What we are getting at the moment from the German Government are schöne Wörter - fine words. No new deeds. At most it is going as far as the previous government went, but no further. Absolutely nothing new is being done in real terms. But the language used is splendid. Old ideas are being dressed up in splendid new words. But we are interested in deeds, in action. I think it is important that the rapporteur has emphasised the need for action, for real and new jobs here and not various kinds of redistribution and other solutions, and not the fine words of the Federal Chancellor. What we need is action, and it is on this that we shall ultimately be judged.
costep_1998-10-21_4_16	Mr President, I very much doubt if there is much to rejoice about in what the international community has achieved over the last few weeks. I think the sentence 'Milosevic has been forced to negotiate' ought to be turned round the other way. Is it not rather that Milosevic has forced the international community to negotiate? Implementation of Security Council resolution 1199 has not even been negotiated with Milosevic, only the points he wanted to discuss were dealt with. In fact, nothing has changed following the agreements. For example, might not the verifiers sent to Kosovo end up as hostages? Suppose Belgrade fails to honour the agreement, will the international community, will NATO risk a military intervention with 2 000 verifiers on the ground? That would be sheer madness. It is a trick, a trick which could prove fatal. Does the Council still remember the aim of democratising Yugoslavia? Will any notice ever be taken of Mr González? Or are we to remain lost forever in Mr Holbrooke’s maze? For once, Mr Dupuis, I can actually agree with you: Milosevic is an international criminal and must be brought to trial at The Hague.
costep_1997-05-28_9_6	Madam President, my congratulations go to our rapporteur Mr Harrison, who has produced an excellent report on an extremely important issue. The application of the single market has caused a revolution in the Member States of the European Union. Even if the rather unrealistic expectations set out in the Cecchini reports have not always come to fruition, such as the millions of extra jobs, at least investment has increased, inflation has fallen, between 300 000 and 900 000 new jobs have been created, and the economies of the Member States have become closely interwoven. But there is still much that needs to be done. Look at public contracts, for example. France and Germany are making a complete hash of the directives in this area, and this is something that needs to be looked into very carefully. Then there are financial services and insurance, where we still do not have a single market within the Union and a great deal more needs to be done. A considerable number of measures have still not been implemented by the Member States, and in order to give fresh impetus to the completion of the single market, the Commission is to put an action plan before the European Council in Amsterdam in June. It is urgently needed. Member States are either too late with their implementation, or else they introduce so much legislation that you cannot see the wood for the trees. Even Parliament, to be honest, is sometimes guilty of this. The target date for harmonization is long past, yet the barriers still remain. Next, small and medium-sized businesses. As the Commission also notes in its working document 'The 1996 Single Market Review', small and medium-sized businesses have benefited less from the single market than large firms, and my group would like to join Mr Harrison in expressing our concern about this through his resolution. The completion of the single market must be made more profitable for SMEs by increasing their exports, for example, which is where the euro and its associated payment systems will help. The costs of complying with the new administrative, technical and fiscal single market legislation also present a major problem for small and medium-sized firms, and I would urge the Commissioner to listen very carefully to what these firms have to say about the problems they are facing. Simpler and clearer legislation would help them more than all sorts of different subsidies that are difficult to obtain. What do small and medium-sized firms actually want? They want better consultation procedures in all kinds of fields such as economic dialogue, trade dialogue, social dialogue, perhaps even fiscal dialogue. They want improvements in the collective research and development programmes for SMEs, and they want them to be made more accessible. Thirdly, there is the reduction in the financial burden for firms operating across borders and in the costs of international bank transactions. The directive on this is to come into force at the same time as the euro. I think we do not have any further problems with this, and I hope that the action plan will work. The single market is one of the European Union’s most important achievements, but without this fresh impetus, we can only expect its benefits to be diluted by enlargement. Strict management and discipline are required from the Member States if the single market is to be preserved.
costep_2007-11-14_2_12	First of all, I would like to remind the Commission and the Council that the globalisation is not a process that exists in itself, that Europe is a big factor in world politics and that the policy pursued by Europe will determine whether globalisation will develop. And it is exactly this that I could not understand from the strategy of the Commission. Is the Commission willing to pursue a policy that will develop globalisation or slow down this process? Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the single market, on its own, is not a guarantee for Europe’s success in the globalisation development process. The Council has declared that it finds competitiveness to be very important but currently there are new economies in the European Union, which are fragile and lack competitiveness even on the internal market. The Commission, in its turn, has stated that it considers the development of the Lisbon Strategy to be most important for them with a view to implementing their plans from the globalisation perspective. Specially for Bulgaria, I expect the Lisbon Strategy to fail because my country, as we have repeatedly stated, was not ready when it joined the European Union. Therefore how can we protect the interests of the European citizens if we do not use some forms of protectionism? The open society that Graham Watson is talking about is simply traitorous to the weaker economies in the EU. If we have global solidarity first instead of solidarity within the Community, then why do we need the Community at all? In this context, a future development of globalisation with weak economies that have big trade deficit and are not competitive even on the internal market would continue to pressurize these economies up to the point of breakdown and these economies which have been fighting to embark on a normal way of development would disintegrate as houses of cards.
costep_2000-11-15_4_17	Mr President, I voted for this report, which lays down the action to be taken by the European Community in order to bring about genuine gender equality. Before leaving to come to Strasbourg last Sunday, I met Mrs Rossi. Mrs Rossi - who is a pensioner, a widow - asked me: Why is it that, as a widow, the pension I receive is only half the amount that it used to be when my dear husband was alive?"". Now then, I would like to make it clear that, when we discuss gender equality, we should also concern ourselves with the pension laws which are discriminatory towards women. The Member States must also respect women in their laws on widows and married women’s pensions.
costep_2003-10-23_1_160	Mr President, what I have to say supplements what my colleague Mr Bowis said. We are both members of the delegation on Central Asia, and it is partly thanks to him and his great commitment that we are able to put this kind of issue back on the agenda. I should like to begin with Turkmenistan. I am still rapporteur for a new cooperation agreement between the EU and Turkmenistan. Parliament, along with the Commission, has stated that it does not actually want to conclude that agreement, nor does it want to discuss it. There is every reason for this. As Mr Bowis and other fellow Members have already stated, it is perfectly clear, looking at the current situation, that that regime is unacceptable. At the same time, however, we have to think about what we can do for the people of Turkmenistan. We believe that Parliament must make an urgent appeal for the Red Cross to be able to visit the prisoners again in any event, for us to be able to resume good contact with the NGOs, and for those NGOs to have some freedom once again in those countries. We must stand up for the people - including politicians and human rights activists - who are currently incarcerated. We must stand up for freedom of belief. It is too absurd for words that only a certain form of Islam, and only the Orthodox Church, still have some degree of freedom, or in any event still enjoy a measure of protection, while all the other groups, both Christian and non-Christian, lack that protection. This is unacceptable, because people and religion belong together. With regard to a number of the other countries mentioned, I should like to point out that, in spring of this year, we also discussed a resolution on Kazakhstan. That led to intensive talks between our delegation and parliamentary delegations from Kazakhstan, and improvements were introduced on a number of items. We are still finding ourselves disappointed on many counts, however: legal procedures, freedom of the press, and also freedom of organisation. I hope that these first steps that Kazakhstan has made in the right direction are not the last, but instead that further pressure, including on the part of the European Union, will lead to improvements in the situation in that country. I wish to make a passionate plea for a new cooperation agreement with Tajikistan. Fortunately, the Commission is currently preparing an agreement for that country, too, which is an extremely good thing, because we must keep close to these countries. Mr Bowis has already described the situation in Uzbekistan, and I have nothing to add. That leaves Kyrgyzstan. The present resolution rightly levels a number of criticisms, but, at the same time, we have here a country that deserves our warm support, because it is trying, with ups and downs, to build a democracy, despite having no resources and no oil. There should be criticism where criticism is due, but, even more importantly, support where support is due. I also wish to express to the Commission my hope that, in coming years, when it comes to Central Asia, the European Union will perhaps give a little extra support to a country such as this, in particular, which has no oil and no resources.
costep_1997-02-20_7_65	Mr President, the purpose of this motion is to demonstrate, with reference to a list of facts which could unfortunately be even longer, that racism today is indeed an actual and growing reality throughout Europe. Although each country has its own specific national features in this area, the foundations of racism are the same everywhere: in essence, the instinctive and simplistic rejection of those who are different, different in their skin colour or their culture, or alternatively a deep-seated and longstanding social crisis, portrayed as inevitable by succeeding governments which refuse to equip themselves with the resources to master it. France takes the biscuit - if I can put it that way - with its political translation of these two foundations of racism into the electoral successes of the National Front. The French Government, which, though protesting, allows attacks on freedom of expression and creativity and allows cultural censorship to operate in Toulon and certain other cities, is violating democracy. A form of hypocrisy that ill conceals ultra liberal orientations which further increase insecurity and poverty. In any case, what can you expect of an administration that makes use of laws such as the Pasqua laws and the Debré laws; which exploits, by legitimizing it, the racist argument of the far Right parties, equating a foreigner with an illegal immigrant and an illegal immigrant with a delinquent? Rap, hip-hop, contemporary creativity in general, all these artistic movements which have been censored or threatened with censor are shot through and enriched with the diversity of the world’s cultures, and call upon us to open our hearts and minds to welcome the foreigner in the words of Jacques Prévert: ' Strange strangers, you are part of the city, you are part of its life.'
costep_2010-05-05_14_143	The Treaty of Lisbon addresses the democratic deficit by strengthening the powers of both the European Parliament and the national parliaments. That is the framework for this new instrument, which allows the legislator to delegate part of its powers to the Commission (Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union), provided that it is an act of general application that is used to supplement or amend parts of a legislative act that are not considered essential. It will thus make it quicker and simpler to fill gaps or to regulate or update more detailed aspects in a legislative act, avoiding excessively complicated and prolonged legislative procedures, which used to have negative consequences for the public. Two aspects that have been safeguarded are the fact that the delegation may be withdrawn at any time and the fact that Parliament’s (and the Council’s) prior assent is needed before the entry into force of acts approved by the Commission under a delegation. I support this innovation, which should take the place of the notorious 'comitology' system, but we now urgently need to set out how these delegations can be made, their scope, their objective, the working methods to be used and the terms on which the legislator can exercise control.
costep_2011-03-24_7_144	We are faced with an agreement that serves the objectives of liberalisation within the air services sector, with the justification, as in other cases, that the 2002 ruling of the EU Court of Justice deems existing bilateral agreements contravene Union law. Once again, as in other regrettable situations, the interpretation of Union law seems to give priority to freedom of competition over all other social and economic precepts, even where there are bilateral agreements between Member States. We are therefore expressing the same reservations that we have about other agreements, their scope and their possible consequences. Within the current context in which civil aviation activity is taking place, the creation of equal conditions for the various European companies could contribute to facilitating the process of monopolistic concentration within the sector that is already under way, with all the adverse effects that this would have for aviation company workers and for passengers. The ability of Member States to defend their flag carriers should not be reduced.
costep_2010-05-19_3_86	The large-scale economic crisis of the last few years has contributed to the failure of the objectives set by the EU at the start of this century. This is the reason why it is important for us to identify the shortcomings of the Lisbon Agenda and focus on the positive results that have been achieved, as well as avoid the mistakes made in the past. I believe that it is important for us now to be able to learn the lesson from the Lisbon Strategy’s failure and also to have the ability to take action to mitigate the impact of this in future. I think that we have the great advantage of knowing the reasons for failure and of successfully avoiding them as part of the new EU 2020 strategy. I would particularly like to focus at this point on strengthening multi-level governance. We must involve local and regional authorities, as well as civil society, in the governance process since, according to EU statistics, local and regional authorities enjoy the highest level of trust among ordinary citizens. At the same time, reinforcing the regional aspect is included on the list of the EU 2020 strategy’s priorities. In this respect, I feel that the role of the future Cohesion policy is to identify and utilise specific local potential.
costep_2005-04-27_1_50	Mr President, Commissioner, the Roma have been present on European soil for many centuries, since they arrived in Greece in the fourth century. Although no census of this population has been made, their number is estimated at around eight million scattered throughout Europe. The Roma are victims of discrimination, marginalisation and segregation in all fields of public and private life, including access to the civil service, education, employment, health services and housing, not to mention when crossing borders and in access to asylum procedures. That discrimination is no longer a problem for the Roma alone, but is of concern to all Europeans, and we must show solidarity to improve their living conditions. We must of course strongly condemn all discrimination to which the Roma are subject, but we must also allow them access to decent housing, education, medical services and social protection. We really must do everything possible to see that they are not forced to leave their countries because of the deplorable living conditions they have to endure there, which may go as far as persecution. Europe must recognise the Roma minority as such so that it can give them the means to fight against all forms of discrimination. That is why we are asking the Commission for an action plan that will make clear recommendations to the Member States and the candidate countries for a better economic integration, yes, but also social and political integration of all the Roma in Europe. We have been talking about it for a long time and it is high time for action. The situation has gone on for long enough. The rights of the Roma must go beyond access to decent living conditions. Europe is the cradle of multiculturalism. The promotion of Roma culture will play an important part in the fight against discrimination, racism and xenophobia. They must be able to remain at home if they want to, they must not be chased along the roads; that is important, it is essential for all of us. It is our duty to act and to act quickly.
costep_2011-06-08_7_205	The first item in the preamble illustrates the vision guiding this report: it states that the multilateral trade system established through the World Trade Organisation (WTO) continues to represent the most suitable framework for regulating and promoting open and fair trade. It continues by advocating the successful conclusion of the Doha Round. This is a vision that is developed in the subsequent points of a resolution with which we naturally disagree. We disagree, in fact, just like the millions of workers, farmers, small and medium-sized business owners, and many others across the world who have, for years, been pointing an accusing finger at the WTO, at its goals of deregulating trade and at the interests it serves: those of the multinationals; of large companies and financial institutions, which rake in millions at the expense of sacrificing millions of jobs and labour and social rights, destroying small and medium-sized producers and degrading the environment. The EU-Canada Free Trade Agreement, like the others, also covers services and worthy, but inconsistent concerns are being expressed relating to 'negative lists' or others, which do not remove the threats also hanging over public services. There are more than enough reasons to vote against.
costep_2010-11-25_9_311	Yannick Jadot’s report reminds us that trade in goods and services accounts for approximately 20% of global greenhouse emissions, a fact that should be taken into account in efforts to tackle climate change. Although the European Union has put ambitious climate policies in place, trade policies also need to reflect this political priority. I have to join the rapporteur in deploring the fact that countries which subsidise energy prices and fail to limit or apply quotas to CO2 emissions may enjoy a competitive advantage. It is a pity that these countries have no interest in subscribing to multilateral agreements on climate change and are therefore encouraging unfair competition. The European Union’s trade policy is not an end in itself - it must remain a political regulatory tool. We need to ensure fair competition and refuse to allow our efforts to address climate change to become a disadvantage in terms of world trade.
costep_2006-10-24_14_31	Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I wish to thank the general rapporteur on the budget, Mr Elles, for his excellent preparatory work. He has demonstrated intimate knowledge of the work of the EU and the administration of its funds. His approach has been well-argued and bold. At the same time I want to thank Mr Grech for the excellent and responsible job that he has done, and Mr Lewandowski for his skilful leadership of the Committee on Budgets. The 2007 budget is the first to be drafted within the framework of the new financial perspectives. It is, moreover, an initial source of financing for new programmes and a final one for old commitments. The draft budget is moderate. It remains within the framework of the financial perspectives, and it does not even propose the use of the flexibility instrument. Nevertheless, it has clear priorities. In my opinion, it is quite right that appropriations for training, research and development have been increased. We must build more than just a pile of paper round the Lisbon Strategy. For that reason, we still need to make it easier for enterprise to flourish, which will mean competitiveness under the CIP Programme and a clear boost for innovation. All these have been among our group’s objectives. The Northern Dimension and cooperation in the Baltic Sea region have been on the agenda for a long time, and it has been considered important to develop them. My group has tabled two draft amendments, Amendments 492 and 493, in which there is an addition to the explanatory statement for the budget headings on pan-European road and gas networks, which states that funds could also be used for financing projects which implement the strategies referred to. I hope that there is support for these draft amendments.
costep_2010-04-21_7_21	Mr President, the speeches by Mrs Roithová, Mr Březina and Mr Mészáros really convinced me, since they described how there was similarly indiscriminate exploitation in the country in which they lived previously, namely Communist Czechoslovakia, how there has been a change in attitude and how today, they are the ones who are advocating environmental protection and common European standards. I believe we need this change in attitude throughout Europe. We must be aware of the fact that we are in the process of developing new technologies. Why not stretch out the mining of a reserve that is running out anyway and first of all develop these new technologies? I would like to make one point quite clear: if we are not careful, something irretrievable will be destroyed and future generations will damn us for it. I therefore really must ask for a long-term approach here. It is crucial that we have uniform European standards, since rivers cross borders and cyanide is, of course, also an environmental hazard that crosses borders.
costep_1999-03-23_3_14	On the Bourlanges report, Mr President, one of the biggest problems as regards the year 2000 budgetary procedure is the enormous scale of monies still unspent. To tackle this as quickly as possible, the rapporteur is suggesting that 50 % of the payment appropriations should be included in the budget for 2000. If we add the expected 'fresh funds', this will give us a budget of EUR 95 billion. Leaving aside the question of whether the Council is likely to welcome so big a budget, I do not think this is the answer. How is it, I would ask the rapporteur, that payments can fall so far short of commitments? You mention the restrictive budgetary policy in recent years. But is that the real reason? In recent years, the budgetary authority has saddled the Commission with a mountain of commitments. Is it not rather the case that the Commission’s services are unable to manage it all? Given the findings of the Committee of Wise Men, I fear that it may be. So a forced increase in payment appropriations for the year 2000 is not the right way. It is asking for trouble. The solution should instead be sought through sensible self-restraint. The commitment appropriations must be matched to the Commission’s capacity for implementing them. Europe must confine itself to policy areas where acting together as a Union is beneficial. Programmes which cannot be managed efficiently must be scrapped, and quickly.
costep_2011-02-16_11_7	Madam President, Commissioner, as in 2008, the price of agricultural raw materials is soaring on world markets. We are only at 3% of the 2008 level. The fall in production in certain traditionally exporting areas due to climate change, the diversion of cereals to biofuel production and the financial speculation accentuating the price rises are responsible for this situation, as evidenced by the reports of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the French authorities, and as also indicated by the Commission. The consequences of this new food crisis are exacting a heavy toll on the 1.2 billion people in the world who live on less than USD 1.5 a day. Since October, 44 million more people have joined those who live below the poverty line. Just two days before the meeting of the G20, what is Europe waiting for before it takes measures similar to those voted in favour of by the United States? Since 13 January 2011, the US administration has demanded the limitation and the transparency of the positions taken by the financial funds on the agricultural commodities markets. This is a first step towards countering the appetites of the speculators. The impact is also dramatic for European farmers. They are no longer able to feed their animals. Hundreds of farms have gone bankrupt. Five years ago, wheat was worth EUR 100 per tonne; today it is traded at close to EUR 300. This is a whole new ball game. The Commission is demanding that farmers adapt to market signals. It would do well, today, to follow its own advice. Faced with this crisis, the European Union cannot wait until 2014 to find solutions. The crisis must be confronted and I propose three concrete actions. Firstly the immediate creation, in the relevant countries, of cereal stocks to be made available to farmers at a subsidised price. Secondly, the indexation of meat prices paid to farmers to fodder prices. Thirdly, for 2011, a mechanism for transferring part of the aid directed at supporting cereals towards livestock farming.
costep_2010-05-18_17_11	The example provided by the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico forces us to think carefully about investment projects under way in the European Union. I am talking about the Northern Gas Pipeline, which is being built in defiance of recommendations made by the European Parliament. The source of the gas will be the Russian Stockman field in the Barents Sea. The project plans the extraction of 24 billion m3 of gas annually in the first phase, but this will then rise to 68 billion. To obtain this amount of gas, many boreholes have to be made in a very short space of time. It will not be possible to stop the stream of 148 000 tonnes of methane, because there are no valves or transit stations. Damage to the pipeline will by no means mean its closure. Gas will continue to flow out until the fault has been repaired, because if water got inside, it would cripple the pipeline completely. Therefore, I call upon the Commission to carry out a thorough analysis of the dangers presented by development projects of this kind.
costep_2007-10-10_18_7	Mr President, I was a member of the five-man delegation from the European Parliament which spent a couple of important days in the Palestinian Autonomous Area. I can categorically state that our mission was humanitarian in nature, not political. I am saying this because I would not like our debate to turn into a very political debate, where the European Parliament takes the role of a prosecutor acting against someone. I would like us to stand above political divisions and consider how we can help civil Palestine. Let us, however, make it clear that it appears that raising the standard of living in the Gaza Strip, normal functioning of hospitals and schools, full access to drinking water, food and electricity, the potential to work normally in agriculture are more likely to cause a fall in tension in Palestinian-Israeli relations and to ensure a weakening of the potential for enmity, where Jewish settlers, Israeli settlers and the State of Israel as such are concerned. A few months ago I spoke in this House about the controversial texts delivered in some Palestinian schools, in Palestinian textbooks, but now we have moved from one extreme to another. We cannot criticise certain aspects of Palestinian schooling any longer, as that system of schooling has effectively died. But this coin has another side to it, an intra-Palestinian aspect. The political stalemate between Hamas and Fatah and the President Abu Mazen camp continues. This impasse makes it difficult for Palestinian institutions to function, and thus hurts Palestinians who live there, and is certainly not Israel’s fault. We speak a lot about lasting peace between the State of Israel and the Palestinians, but that is a bit like talking about a house and starting with the roof. We should always talk from the foundations up, and the foundations in this case are an improvement in the functioning of Palestinian power structures, public institutions and humanitarian assistance for the people of Palestine.
costep_1998-06-18_4_20	Mr President, the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea for possession of territory measuring 400 km2 is another exceptionally good example of the destructive power of incorrect consultation, of war, of senseless violence, when preventative diplomacy might perhaps have accomplished something. Unfortunately these destitute countries, which as neighbours got along well until about three months ago, are not themselves able to prevent this mutual destruction. Yet all border disputes can be resolved by mediation, with give and take on both sides. The parties must be encouraged to accept a cease-fire. I therefore welcome the commitment and the willingness of the Rwandan government and the Egyptian President. The Union must show itself willing to offer all the help needed and certainly emergency aid for refugees. These poor countries must be made to understand that a military solution is never the real answer for small and large conflicts of this kind. A military solution cannot be a durable one.
costep_2009-05-05_10_22	Madam President, 16% of Europeans are at risk of poverty. The crisis is producing a series of group redundancies. Lack of work is the main cause of deep poverty. Poverty promotes social exclusion and restricts access to education and health care. In spite of the economic crisis, we want to preserve European social models which foster social cohesion and solidarity, and this includes tackling poverty. Economic independence guarantees dignity. This is why it is so important to protect jobs and incomes, and also to improve professional qualifications which increase mobility in the job market. One thing which allows us to feel that we have real control over our lives is the ability to participate in decision making. Therefore it is essential to respect the opinions of social partners, the process of social dialogue, group agreements and social settlements. We should work together to ensure the existence of conditions which enable people to earn enough to participate in the life of society and to support their family, especially where they have many children. We should also tackle discrimination in the job market, especially as it affects people with disabilities. The fact that during the crisis barely 3% of the funds available in the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund have been used is an indictment of politicians. I congratulate the rapporteurs.
costep_2006-12-13_4_23	Mr President, the European institutions are finally getting down to the main points. What is the European Union? What does it want? Who can be part of it? I hope that, thanks to the Stubb and Brok resolutions, our European Parliament will clearly help to abandon the pretence and stop forging ahead with the enlargement strategy. Integration capacity is very well defined by the three elements that appear in paragraph 8 of the Brok report. As far as we are concerned, priority must be given to political projects and not just to the institutions. We are against enlargement leading to the dismantling of common policies. It is true that integration capacity, as rightly defined by Mr Stubb, does not constitute an accession criterion, but a condition for moving on to accession. For the time being, we believe, like Mr Stubb, that a further enlargement cannot take place without new decision-making mechanisms, without new resources and without new representation of the Union. That is the conclusion that we currently draw from the unfortunate comparison between the accession to the Union of the 12 new Member States, which is a success, and the Treaty of Nice, which, for its part, is totally inadequate. Let us be as clear-sighted in our reasoning regarding Turkey. The General Affairs Council has noted the consequences of Cyprus' situation, which is, of course, intolerable, but are we not just talking here about another diplomatic deception? The suspension is in danger of being ineffective and of doing nothing to change Turkey’s attitude. Our position must be reaffirmed; the Union is in no position to integrate Turkey, but must implement a privileged partnership with this country, which is crucial to Europe. Let us stop pretending; this is a question of interests and of Turkey and of the European Union. Enlargement is not an end in itself; it is a means of building Europe’s political project.
costep_2005-10-24_1_46	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that the programme exists in its present form, having been influenced by all the experience we have had with the Socrates programme over the past ten years, and with the attempt having been made to avoid the old mistakes and go down new paths. Even so, as there are, proverbially, many roads that lead to Rome, this House has included even more new approaches, and we should try to take a good look at all of them at least once. Let me explain, for the sake of completeness, what sub-programmes we are dealing with here: the programme has to do, overall, with general and vocational education, and it is a good thing that vocational education is now included. The programme enables everyone to take part in educational programmes virtually from the cradle to the grave. The first programme open to all is ‘Comenius’. It is aimed at those who have to attend school in any case; to those for whom school attendance is mandatory, it gives the opportunity to discover at an early age what is meant by cultural differences, or a common approach, to particular issues in different countries. Next comes the Erasmus programme, which gives these pupils the opportunity, once they have become students, to spend part of their course in another European country and to take their achievements there back home with them. Running in parallel to that is the Leonardo programme, which enables apprentices and trainees to complete part of their training in the form of a work placement in another European country. The fourth programme, ‘Grundtvig’, deals with the education of adults, and the fifth, named after Jean Monnet, provides support. This involves the celebrated institutions to which you referred, and to which we want to add two more. I hope that Parliament will agree to this. We do, however, want to continue to support the Jean Monnet chairs and all those things for which your programme already makes provision. There are also the horizontal programmes in support of these activities, which overlap with the sectoral programmes that have already been mentioned, particularly in the development of material for language learning, learning and the dissemination of best practice in general and vocational education at national, regional and local level. We have made further improvements to your proposals and have, in particular, emphasised that the Comenius partnerships should enable one pupil in fifteen, rather than one in twenty, to spend a school year abroad, which would add up to a total of 6 million pupils in junior secondary school having the possibility of spending a year as guest students at a school in another EU country. Together with my fellow-members of the Committee for Culture and Education, I have also ensured that teachers’ European awareness can be enhanced through the new Comenius Regio programme. We have also proposed that the Erasmus programme’s mobility grant, which has remained unchanged since 1993, should be increased, for EUR 150 is an insufficient sum of money with which to go and live and study in another country, and makes support from parents, grandparents and relatives indispensable. We should, however, be enabling all students to take part in an exchange of this kind, and so we suggest that the monthly grant should be increased by rather more than the Commission has suggested. It is of course as important to me as it is to the Commission that there should be a decent reduction in the amount of red tape involved. Administrative and financial constraints on the award and payment of grants must be commensurate with the amount paid out. Let me briefly consider the issue of finance. Only indicative figures have been given for the financial resources we are talking about today. Nobody knows how much we will have at our disposal after 2007; that is why the figures - the Commission’s, the Böge Committee’s and our own Committee’s - are no more than indications. We have to wait and see what we will get from the next Presidency of the Council, and so the Culture Committee has taken the liberty of going beyond the figures proposed by the Commission, and also a bit beyond those agreed by the Böge Committee. We should put down a marker; education and training are a vital part of the Lisbon process. We need them, and in order to have them we need more money than the national governments in the European Union are prepared to make available. Many thanks, Commissioner, for the work your staff have done!
costep_2006-11-29_18_30	Mr President, European research has gradually dedicated more room to issues relating to the environment, to people and to culture, thereby attaching more importance to their situations and to their conservation and survival. The attention paid to historical and cultural heritage is an example of this. I would like to thank those people in the Commission who have supported it. The same should be said of the inclusion of the entertainment and multimedia industry, information technologies and social sciences in the programme, as well as the innovation of introducing research relating to intelligence and the fight against terrorism. I am pleased with the agreements reached on stem cell research: we have set clear limits respecting all sensitivities, the funding of human cloning, the cloning or creation of embryos for research and their destruction has been banned, at all times under the control of regional, national and international bodies. When I speak to patients and their families, I am moved by their capacity to embrace hope. They know that it may not be they who benefit from the solutions, but they feel obliged to defend that ray of hope for new patients; I certainly will not be taking that hope away from them. Research has always been a feature of European culture; the great European researcher, Steiner, said that. Creativity and research are aspects of our identity.
costep_2011-05-11_6_387	I voted on this report because it presents the European Parliament’s reaction to the Green Paper published by the Commission, intended to begin public consultation on forest protection and preparing forests for climate change throughout the European Union. In the report, Parliament welcomes the Commission’s Green Paper and calls for the EU forestry strategy to be updated, while properly taking into account the application of the subsidiarity and proportionality principles and including the climate-change dimension and broader forest protection issues. Parliament also reaffirms its view on the need for increased levels of funding for forest protection measures through the rural development pillar of the common agricultural policy, particularly given the new challenges entailed in climate change. Among other possible sources of financing, the report also proposes considering the possibility of paying companies for ecosystem services, through which they contribute to biodiversity conservation and forest protection. Among many other measures, such as strengthening coordination at EU level and information exchange between Member States, the Commission is also urged to consider submitting a legislative proposal prohibiting building on land cleared by fires proven to have resulted from arson.
costep_1999-11-16_5_16	Mr President, Commissioner, it is with great satisfaction that I receive the Commission communication on the inclusion of environmental aspects in the energy policy, even if, like many people, I must deplore the serious delays which have arisen in this field in Europe. In fact, many Member States, with jurisdiction in this area, have too often chosen to overlook this issue, resulting in real ecological disasters. For all that, now that the requirement has been established, apparently with general consensus, the problem of implementation arrangements remains and, here, the task of reconciling the policies proposed is far from being as easy. It is a source, indeed, of a great deal of disagreement, on a par with any of the challenges which the European Union must meet. As far as I, and others, of course, are concerned, the main challenges are as follows. Firstly there is the challenge of the safety of our power supplies and the energy dependence of the European Union, a dependence which is going to grow and which is likely, we are told, to reach 70% in the year 2020, with all the consequent political risks. Next, there is the commitment made at Kyoto to reduce CO2 emissions by 8% relative to their 1990 level. Confronted with these two challenges, there are some arguing in favour of the all-nuclear solution, while others are arguing in favour of completely giving up nuclear power. Personally, I do not think that either of these two extremes offers the solution to environment protection. I would be more in favour of a balanced development of energy sources, retaining the nuclear share but especially developing renewable energies. The European Union has set the target of increasing the share of renewable energies from 6% to 12% by the year 2010, but the financial resources must be found for this and, today, we are a long way off, to judge by the latest discussion in the Conciliation Committee. A further challenge, an absolutely major one, is related to the contradiction, a particularly serious contradiction, I feel, between the liberalisation of energy networks, which, while it certainly affords a certain reduction in prices, also, by the same token, favours waste, and the promotion of rational and economic energy use. To the pro-liberals I say that it is necessary to recognise that the market does not solve all problems and ultraliberalism has negative effects. In order to meet these challenges and overcome these contradictions, what we need, very quickly, is cooperation at every level, in the Member States and with candidate countries, to enlist the assistance of candidate countries and to work within the terms of the fifth framework programme. The rapporteur has done an excellent job and has produced some excellent proposals. I would like, in conclusion, to congratulate him on this.
costep_2006-06-15_1_30	Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members of the European Parliament for their excellent and fruitful cooperation. We had 1700 amendments, so the interest in the Seventh Framework Programme was huge. I would particularly like to thank my colleagues from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, who put in the most work. Cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs was excellent, and I should like to thank my colleagues for their cooperation. The Commission officials and political group advisors also put in a lot of work. Thanks to the Seventh Framework Programme, we want to exploit the potential of all the 25 European Union Member States. We want to take advantage of the experience of the best people and infrastructure. The European Parliament has acted quickly, effectively and responsibly. We must not slow down the pace. We must launch the programme on 1 January 2007, and this is my call to you. Before the vote:
costep_2011-06-08_7_210	In view of the fact that the European Union is Canada’s second largest trade partner, and that Canada is a major partner for the EU in the field of foreign direct investment, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on EU-Canada trade relations. At the same time, I would like to emphasise that Poland is Canada’s largest trading partner among the Central and Eastern European countries and, for a dozen or so years, has maintained a bilateral trade surplus which has grown year on year. Today’s vote is a key step forward which bodes well for the future.
costep_2011-03-24_7_408	On 11 March the Pacific region, and Japan in particular, was rocked by a devastating earthquake and tsunami. I believe that it is important to mention once again here that natural disasters are increasing in number and intensity, and it is therefore necessary to rethink pre- and post-crisis scenarios at a global level in order to anticipate and provide assistance to the countries affected. At the same time, the natural disaster also caused an extremely serious nuclear accident, which has affected the Fukushima nuclear plant in particular. This event has shown that it is crucial to think about safety conditions at European nuclear plants. I would therefore like to call for a discussion, preceded by a thorough analysis, on how to reduce the devastating effects of a nuclear accident on the regions and people where it occurs. I welcome the EU’s willingness to extend all humanitarian, technical and financial aid as a priority, along with the instant activation of the European civil protection mechanism. However, I believe that it is vital to grant this mechanism more logistic and planning resources so that it can become a real mechanism for the protection of the countries affected.
costep_2000-07-03_6_27	Mr President, on 28 June the EU held its first summit with the largest democracy in the world and the second-largest trading power in Asia. India - and Commissioner Patten made this point - whose importance is often underestimated, has finally received the recognition which, in the light of its economic and political dynamism, it deserves. In the end the time was not wasted in exchanging pleasantries. It was possible to sign real agreements. It is not only for us, the EU, as India’s largest trading partner, that it is important for further protectionist barriers to be dismantled and for liberalisation to be able to continue. The response to the reform process is significant additional investment from Europe. In mid-April our SAARC Delegation - of which I am Vice-Chairman - was able to see very clearly for itself in Delhi how much progress has already been made in restructuring the economy. In the new economy - information technology, for example - we are once again the most important partner. But we will only be able to take advantage of these well-trained technicians and qualified employees if the idea - which has not been thought through - of having a system of green cards is finally dismissed. A green card with a time limit will not work at all. We need cooperation between European and Indian companies. Employees can then be posted anywhere and they will have clear contracts which are valid throughout the world. At the summit, think tanks, contacts with NGOs and new networks were discussed. We have shared values. All the more important then are the respect for human rights, ethnic minorities and dissidents and the abolition of child labour. This is in no way a uniquely western way of thinking; these values are at the root of a shared democratic consciousness. The fight against unemployment and exclusion needs to be fought with the same intensity as the fight against terrorism and crime, and this was agreed by both sides. I hope now that the meeting of political and economic leaders will be the first page in a new book in which young people from universities, schools and businesses will also play their part. So Mr President, let us support exchange programmes so that people can meet one another, understand one another’s way of thinking and in the future work alongside one another!
costep_2005-12-15_1_7	Mr President, I am asking for the floor under Rule 145 on personal statements, which allows me to speak for up to three minutes; I will not take that much time. Mr President, the verbatim report of Tuesday’s part-session has only just been made available to us, and it has brought to my attention a personal attack made against me by a man who, until then, I had believed was presiding over the sitting courteously and impartially. I am referring to the vice-president of the sitting in question, who saw fit to interrupt me and to take sides regarding the background to my dispute with the French Government. His reference to a historical fact - the tragedy of the Struthof camp - even shows that he is completely ignorant of the ins and outs of this tragedy, and of the most recent work of historians on this subject. The president of the sitting also saw fit to make a comment following one of my colleagues’ speeches, even though it contained no personal attacks and no insulting comments. In all of my considerable parliamentary experience, I have never seen a sitting president act as arrogantly as Mr McMillan Scott and I find it deeply regrettable. Applause
costep_1998-05-14_6_40	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are shocked and we are indignant, we are sad and we are enraged to learn of the brutal attempt on the life of Akin Birdal. My dear Akin, we hope you will be restored to health, we hope that for today, for tomorrow and beyond you will be, and you will remain, the old Akin Birdal, always courageous, always determined, always full of hope, the Akin Birdal who was at all times full of humanity, full of cheer and above all uncompromising. The attack on you, Akin, was an attack on democracy in Turkey; an attack on human rights; an attack on all those who are fighting for democracy in Turkey; an attack on all who are pleading for a political solution to the Kurdish problem. The democratization of Turkey is directly bound up with the political settlement of this issue. We call upon the Turkish government at this late hour to take the issue of human rights seriously, and not just to make proclamations at the prayer-wheel, but to create a proper and stable foundation for citizens' rights, human rights, basic rights in Turkey, and to grant freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom to establish political parties. This must apply to everyone, even members of the Fazilet Party. Finally, we call for talks to begin, because only dialogue can produce a political solution. The military way is no solution. What happened to Akin happens every day to many, many people. The violence has got to stop. Please, Akin, get well soon.
costep_2010-02-10_14_8	Mr President, Mr Rubalcaba has rightly said that we currently do not have a secure system for air travel. We need more security in this area. The events in Detroit and Munich have shown that there are security loopholes. For this reason, body scanners are being introduced in a mad rush as if they were a miracle cure. They are already in place in the US, in the Netherlands and in other countries. However, this raises the issue of whether body scanners will really make air travel safer. This is one of the crucial questions that we must ask ourselves. There is, in fact, a whole series of questions relating to body scanners. What type of technology is being used? What type of radiation do they emit? Can they cause damage to health? What do they allow people to see? Just a few green or red dots or the whole person who is being scanned? Finally, can we ensure that the data is being protected? Also, these scanners are expensive. If we are going to install them, who will be paying? There are a lot of questions to be answered and we are in the process of doing this. You also want to do this and present us with a solution. Whatever happens, we need a solution which covers the whole of Europe. We also need to take into consideration Tel Aviv and the possibility of using another method. We need to search for the bombers and not the bombs. We cannot adopt this method wholesale, because it involves discrimination, but we must investigate all the possibilities while protecting our fundamental rights.
costep_2009-01-13_5_12	Mr President, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, Mr Juncker, Mr Trichet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you how, in 1992, when it was still completely dubious as to whether the French would vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty, Jacques Delors spoke to the general assembly of the French Green Party, which managed to deliver the missing 1% or 2%. He said to us: 'Vote for the euro, then we will have a political Europe, because if we do not create a political Europe to control Europe, the people will not accept it; they will never accept it.' He did not persuade us. The Maastricht Treaty was approved, but no political Europe was created. This is the very problem which we are facing today. Why were we against the euro at that time? There were basically two reasons for it. Firstly, it seemed to us that the Maastricht criteria were going to drag Europe into at least five years of pro-cyclical recessionary policy and, secondly, the way in which the monetary policy was incorporated into the general economic policy by the Maastricht Treaty was not satisfactory. For the sake of the European Central Bank’s independence, we would separate monetary policy from the rest of the policies. I must say quite honestly that, even if I am still not convinced by the Maastricht Treaty today, like all the other Greens, I am rather attracted by the changes which the legislation and application of Economic and Monetary Union have undergone. Three major changes have taken place. Firstly, price stability has been established at a level of slightly less than, but close to, 2%. This target may seem a bit absurd. At the moment, when the world is being threatened by deflation and the situation is being aggravated by the tendency of some countries to hastily cut their VAT rate as part of a Keynesian policy, it is obvious that setting this target of 2% is no longer just for show. If we fail to keep to this 2% target we run the risk of having very high real interest rates being forced on us. The second major reform is obviously the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact carried out in 2005, which allows us today to have a policy that is contracyclical and aimed at countering the crisis. The third major transformation is the change to how things work in practice. This permanent dialogue, as highlighted once again in this Chamber, between Mr Trichet, Mr Almunia, Mr Juncker and Mr Barroso, is, strictly speaking, contrary to the Maastricht Treaty itself. I regard this form of cooperation between Mr Trichet and Mr Almunia, for example, to be the equivalent of that between Mr Bernanke and Mr Paulson, which is a positive and desirable development. What remains to be done then? All I would say is that we need to apply properly the good aspects of the Maastricht Treaty. We have a real problem in defining the exchange rate, which has been mentioned on several occasions by my predecessors. The task of setting the exchange rate is assigned to the Council. We must find the means to ensure that the Council sets an exchange rate for Europe which does not derive randomly from the interest rate chosen by the European Central Bank, but properly reflects an industrial policy. We must find the proper instruments to do this. Secondly, the European Central Bank’s objective is not only to maintain a rate close to 2% but also to apply Europe’s policy, by that I mean the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategies. We need to have a policy for refinancing and rediscounting private debts by the European Central Bank according to the Gothenburg and Lisbon Strategies. Lastly, as has already been mentioned, there needs to be supervision at a European level and the European Central Bank is in the best position to perform this function.
costep_2011-05-11_6_201	I voted in favour of this resolution on a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the first radio spectrum policy programme. I agree with the rapporteur’s opinion that the need for one single internal market is crucial for Europe to take a leadership in the global economy, with a focus on the service sector and the knowledge economy. The Digital Agenda and the digital economy can serve as a spearhead for making the Internal Market real for all parts of our economy. This requires an ability to take the lead regarding broadband and the use of the Internet. We must aim to make Europe the best and do what is best for Europe: free up spectrum for new services and increased mobile traffic, laying the ground for new opportunities for culture and content, broadcasters and public services within the framework of broadband. The first radio spectrum policy programme (RSPP) is a significant step in ensuring the efficient and optimal use of this finite resource. Europe must be in the lead in this process of change, creating the best opportunities for a competitive European knowledge economy characterised by vitality, change and innovations. That requires access to Internet and broadband applications with the greatest capacity and the highest speed.
costep_2010-03-24_14_21	Madam President, talking about Tibet here today is a matter of justice and a matter of responsibility. I therefore disagree with those who think that this issue 'was not of concern'. We have been reporting this matter for many years and I am concerned to see that, despite the enormous efforts being made by the Tibetan delegation, and especially the Dalai Lama, to promote dialogue, to move closer to the Chinese authorities, to find a fair and lasting solution to this conflict, the blockade situation is continually caused by the Chinese authorities. We in the European Union cannot go on putting up with this game, far less fuel it. I therefore consider it essential not only to once again remind you of the urgency and relevance of this debate, but also to remind you anew that the one currently standing in the way of a solution is China. We must also be clear in this respect. The only way in which the European Union can be consistent when it says that it is committed to human rights is by accepting that it must also bear a cost in terms of business and in economic terms. Otherwise, nothing will be credible in terms of human rights.
costep_2007-04-25_3_14	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Mr Swoboda’s report in its entirety. The about-turn on collaboration with the court in The Hague was certainly significant, but the government and all the political parties in Croatia need to work harder on public opinion there in order to help close the chapter of nationalist claims once and for all. We are in favour of Croatia’s future accession, because we want this country to consolidate its membership of Europe and to share its values and policies in order to contribute to the stabilisation of the western Balkans. This is something that Italy considers fundamentally important. In that respect, there is no point in reopening painful wounds. Instead, as the report points out, we want to encourage an all-embracing process of truth and reconciliation involving all the interested parties, both in Croatia and in the rest of the Balkans. Legitimate claims concerning minorities in Croatia, including the Italian minority, need to be addressed fully in compliance with international law and all our Community legislation, as indeed the current negotiations require. Their complete integration at all levels of the country’s life is still a fundamental objective. We shall follow the negotiations not least because of that.
costep_2002-05-30_4_10	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, coal will continue to play an important role in energy provision for the foreseeable future. On that point I am at one with the Commission, even though the relative amount of energy produced from coal has become very small in comparison with other primary energy sources. I even think that the Commission should have made even more emphatic reference to hitherto unused capacity to derive energy from coal, as greater effectiveness can be achieved through improved technical procedures, especially combined heat and power. If we - as is indeed only right - include indigenous primary energy sources and thus also coal in the European strategy for security of energy supply, this inevitably leads, in the case of coal, to the requirement that the Member States should have the right to grant aid in this sector, as Community coal production is made uncompetitive by geological conditions and environmental and social standards in the EU. This means that the classes of aid proposed by the Commission - operating aid, closure aid and help with meeting inherited liabilities - are sensible and necessary, although there might very well be different opinions about the period for which this regulation is to run. What I find regrettable about the Commission proposal, in view of the imminent enlargement of the European Union, is that it does not include the coal-producing acceding countries in its scope with effect from the date they join, which is indispensable, and the periods for which the regulation is to run are far too short for these countries to be able to carry out the necessary and painful restructuring of coal mining in, for example, Poland and the Czech Republic. Poland, in any case, produces more coal than the whole of the European Union put together, totalling 102 million tonnes in 2000 over against the EU’s 85 million tonnes. There is a need to catch up here. My group supports the Commission proposal.
costep_1999-03-22_5_55	Mr President, the European Commission resigned because the Committee of Independent Experts which investigated its activities found that it had been mismanaged. President Santer made what was absolutely the right decision and accepted full responsibility. This process has shown that it was immensely important to have set up this independent committee, as it is only because of their work that we have been able to get to grips with the real problems. Without it we would have merely swept matters under the carpet, as it were, having had two or three token resignations from Commission members. Reading this report now, it seems unlikely that we would have had sufficient justification for dismissing everyone. We have to bear in mind, however, that we will need to cooperate extremely closely with the Council in the future. The new Commission must be appointed quickly, and it was very good to hear the President-in-Office of the Council say that the principles of the Treaty of Amsterdam would be respected in this connection. Nevertheless, while we ponder these images of power, we must remember that the most important matter on the agenda at the forthcoming Berlin summit is the approval of Agenda 2000, and in the light of the current situation it is vital that Berlin should be a success. Certain speakers here have proposed that the new Commission might include members of the current one. I believe this has to be examined on the basis of what we want from the Commission. The aim must be to improve the Commission’s work and management culture, and we must have Commissioners who can do this. The current situation should be exploited thoroughly. We need time and energy to bring about reform, and capable people to manage it.
costep_2009-03-26_5_52	I should like to give an explanation of vote on the Batzeli report on behalf of the Dutch delegation from the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA). In our opinion, this is certainly not the most elegant of reports. Many points are worded in a long-winded way or duplicated. We also have our doubts about certain requirements that tend too much towards socialist state intervention, and also about a complete ban on selling below cost. This may sound like a nice idea, but is impracticable. In agriculture, we consider this an important point. With regard to dumping, action should of course be taken by the competition authority. In spite of this, we have voted in favour of the Batzeli report, since it contains a number of important elements that the alternative resolution actually seeks to delete. I refer, in particular, to the study into the margins in the various links in the food production chain and to the call for the European Commission to look into the power of supermarkets in the field of competition, as the European Parliament has already requested more than once. We understand from the European Commission that the study into margins can be carried out partly on the basis of existing data known to the Commission, and thus we assume that this study will not entail any substantial increase in administrative costs.
costep_2005-06-23_1_62	Prime Minister, your speech was inspired and I trust that your European actions will be equally inspired. However, I must point out that the Union has entered a period of crisis, a credibility crisis, and I shall explain why: In March 2000, the European Council agreed on the Lisbon Strategy. During the review last March, it was decided to give greater emphasis to research and innovation. In Brussels in October 2002, the European Council agreed on the 2007-2013 financing framework for agriculture. In Athens in April 2003, all the Heads of State agreed to and endorsed enlargement. That brings us to today. The Lisbon Strategy: the Council proposal for financing the strategy cancels it in practical terms. Agriculture: Prime Minister, you yourself have questioned the compromise on agriculture. Enlargement: you have welcomed the 10 new Member States, but with less money. By contrast, the European Parliament, in adopting the Böge report, has shown that it is consistent in what it professes. Prime Minister, I share your views about the need for reforms which will make us more competitive on the international stage, but we need to combine the validity of this position with respect for what has been agreed. I ask you: Firstly, taking account of the fact that the compromise on agricultural spending was achieved after reciprocal and painful concessions, taking account of the fact that the basic principle of international law is the ' principle and, finally, taking account of the fact that a new compromise will be impossible to achieve today with 25 Member States and the current institutional framework, do you consider it advisable that we exhaust this issue? Secondly, with what budget do you intend Applause
costep_1998-12-16_6_27	Mr President, I should firstly like to congratulate the rapporteurs of these reports because they contain information and proposals that will be of great use to us. What is more, I believe that they contain practically everything we should say and do, and I say practically here and not absolutely everything as that would be going too far. However, I would like to comment on a couple of issues. We have to be much stricter in everything we do within and beyond the European Union, and this is something that I would like to stress in particular. I do not wish to enter into the debate that will take place later, but there are issues where we need to be extremely vigilant, for example, women’s rights and sex tourism, which, as one speaker reminded us, are closely linked to the attitude of Europeans as well as the way in which we treat citizens from third countries. This is because, as regards this last issue in particular, they have a huge impact on our external credibility. For example, in my country, the spectacle of immigrants flooding into Ceuta or Melilla does not help us defend human rights as vigorously and as emphatically as we have been doing. We need to endorse the support programmes for democracy and human rights abroad. Such programmes need our political support, which Parliament duly gives, but the Commission also needs support to enable it to act effectively and take into account exactly how much these programmes cost from both an economic and administrative point of view. This is important because we are sometimes unaware of these points, or if we are aware, we do not act accordingly. And thirdly, I should like to insist - as has often been done here, yet I believe it to be important - on the creation of an International Criminal Court and international legitimacy. It is only through such instruments that we will be able to carry out effective operations that do not lead to new problems or to a new ideological or patrimonial feeling in relation to human rights, operations that might spread all over the world. The Pinochet case, in my opinion, shows that it is only through this international legitimacy, which must be achieved by consensus, that we will be able to progress.
costep_2003-09-24_3_9	Mr President, in giving Europe the text of a Constitution, which will contribute effectively to constructing our future, the Convention has accomplished an important task. This work must be protected from slanderers and opponents but it must also be further improved upon - it is not true that there is no scope to do this - and we must reject the theories of those who do not want to change anything, or else all the work that has been achieved will come to nothing. I share and support, therefore, the proactive view taken by Mr Prodi, who sees the value of the texts but is also aware of the limits and risks that could arise from it. More specifically, I will indicate corrections that I feel are necessary and possible. I am not referring to the inadequate content and inadequate social rights, which, as we know, are the result of the specific balance of powers today. It is no coincidence, for example, that the Constituent Assembly which wrote the marvellous Italian Constitution in the post-war period, had as its President the communist, Umberto Terracini, while our Convention is chaired by the extremely respectable but extremely moderate Mr Giscard d'Estaing. I am, therefore, referring to issues that are purely institutional. Firstly, a full-time President of the Council who is in office for a long period of time, instead of a rotating presidency, would end up overlapping with the President of the Commission and their work would conflict, causing paralysis and crisis in the institutions. Secondly, unanimity voting must be abolished in all areas because the right to veto can, at any time, block any innovative process. Thirdly, there must be a single common foreign policy and it must be accompanied by a European military capacity superseding NATO which would give us not only an independent role but also a stabilising role in the face of the one-sided, imperialist power that is currently present in and threatening the world.
costep_2011-06-23_14_658	The Europe 2020 strategy objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth should be central priorities when considering the future budget for 2012. The European Union’s small and medium-sized companies should also receive particular attention and, as such, it will be appropriate to insist on the need to clarify the budgetary implications of the Europe 2020 strategy’s flagship initiatives. It should be mentioned that, in a context of recovery for many Member States, the European Union budget has a role to take up by reinforcing support for national investment to encourage growth. Therefore, the level of payment allocations, as proposed by the European Commission, should be maintained, whilst taking into account that all programmes should proceed quickly. As such, there is a need to try to focus priorities and to aim to redeploy resources. There are also other areas that should have an equivalent in the budget, such as that of justice, freedom and security, and there is a need to react to events in the Mediterranean too.
costep_2009-12-14_17_23	Madam President, I do not need to add anything to what the Commissioner said. I support what he said, especially his concluding remarks about the question of the future development of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund in relation to the other programmes - in particular the European Social Fund - about which we will, of course, have another intensive joint debate. It is absolutely clear that this Globalisation Adjustment Fund cannot neutralise the consequences of structural change, nor can it accept and overcome the challenges of globalisation, and that, of course, is not its intended purpose. However, it can certainly help the individuals affected, who find themselves in a difficult situation in terms of employment after being made redundant and it can give them the opportunity, through gaining qualifications, to have prospects once more and to find work. That is something that, in spite of the debate about subsidiarity, which of course also plays a part in this connection, we should support and welcome as a supplementary fund to all the measures under the European Social Fund, which we also have. At this point, I would just like to say one more thing and that is that there are certainly programmes in the national, as well as the European, budgets where there are more grounds for calling into question the meaningfulness of the expenditure than there are for a fund that provides assistance directly to people who are in a difficult initial situation.
costep_2007-02-01_8_6	The report omits to mention the underlying causes of the increasingly deep social inequality and disparity in development, of the unchecked exploitation of natural resources and of the massive destruction of the environment around the world, and fails to mention the real culprit, which is capitalism. Despite this, it does contain a wide range of proposals and points that we welcome, such as the call for the target of 0.7% GNI to be met in order to achieve effective development cooperation characterised by solidarity. However, we cannot accept the following points, for example: because 'local authorities in developing countries are not always in a position to provide the volumes of financing required to make major investments in the construction and maintenance of infrastructure networks, for example to supply water or provide sanitation', the report concludes that the solution is 'only supplementary injections of private capital, through public-private partnerships, will be able to provide the requisite volume of funding', thus handing this fundamental resource for life on a plate to private capital; and making the reduction - rather than the cancellation - of the debts of the least-developed countries contingent on what is termed 'good governance', the criteria for which are dictated by the whims of the major powers. Hence our vote.
costep_1998-07-16_5_30	Mr President, if Nigeria, which we have just debated, with the sudden tragic deaths of General Abacha and Chief Abiola, could have perhaps given rise to a tragedy written by a modern Sophocles, then the case of Togo could be worthy of a vaudeville. And it could be described like that if it were not offensive to the people of Togo, who have participated with real enthusiasm and with a democratic will in this first round of presidential elections. Mr President, the resolution prepared by some of our groups is, in my view, extremely moderate and reasonable and, of course, maintains the criterion of those of us who, even before going to the penultimate meeting of the Joint Assembly, had serious doubts regarding the suitability of holding that event in that country. We can only hope now that General Eyadema, satisfied with more than 30 years in power, recognizes that he cannot continue to be a type of Mobutu the Second and that he allows a democratic solution whereby the Togolese people can state their opinions with the freedom that they have lacked until now. Until that time, there is no doubt that we must continue to give our firm and resolute support to the maintenance of the restrictive criteria regarding European aid.
costep_2000-02-15_14_7	Mr President, with regard to the protection of intellectual property rights, the reality always seems to be ahead of the regulations. The evolution of the economy, the appearance of new forms of contract and technological innovations are phenomena which mean frequent and rapid changes which must be taken into account when drawing up regulations. In this field, the process of producing regulations is slow, too slow, given the speed of the actual changes which that legislation is intended to regulate. If this is the case, it is all the more obvious when the process involves multinational or supranational organisations, such as the WIPO, which has debated the treaties which we are proposing to rectify. In considering whether we are in favour of the ratification of these treaties, we may wonder whether they meet the most current needs in that field. It would be difficult to reply in the affirmative. There is no doubt that these treaties update the regulations in this field, but neither is there any doubt that there are currently many problems which they do not resolve. The recent inclusion of the Encyclopaedia Britannica on the Internet and the appearance of virtual libraries have demonstrated that there are still many problems to be resolved. For example, the solution adopted by one of the most significant virtual libraries - which, by the way, belongs to my own university, the University of Alicante - which consists of not including works still protected by copyright, implies a considerable limitation to the development of this type of virtual library. Moreover, ratifying these treaties now is going to be of little relevance. On the one hand, the problems which it aims to resolve have already been resolved to a large extent by means of the directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. On the other hand, the majority of the Member States have already adapted their legislation to the treaties which are now being ratified. I must finally point out that the legislative amendments introduced in a number of countries, such as Spain, have resolved some conflicts but have led to others which are commonly found when it comes to putting a price on rights and material. In such a sensitive field, we must find solutions which balance the different interests involved. Only in this way will the regulations be accepted.
costep_2011-04-07_7_123	The current state of affairs in several African countries, and also in Bahrain, Syria and Yemen, is the result of the people’s legitimate aspiration for political, economic and social reforms aimed at bringing about a genuine democracy. It is well known that repressive laws restricting citizens in the exercise of their civil and political rights have always been in force in those countries. As a result, there is a strong desire among the people for political and social reforms. Unfortunately, the governments are reacting to these legitimate demands with violent repression and the application of anti-terrorism laws intended to justify the extrajudicial execution, torture, abduction and disappearance of many demonstrators. Today, the number of deaths, casualties and arrests in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen is extremely high. The excessive use of force by the governments against demonstrators has violated every single international convention on civil and political rights. I join with the rapporteur in condemning the violent crackdown on peaceful demonstrators by the security forces in those countries, crushing their legitimate democratic aspirations. We must express our complete solidarity and support the courage and determination that these peoples are demonstrating to the entire world.
costep_2011-06-23_14_585	The directive in question applies to emissions from agricultural tractors and its aim is a quantitative amendment to Directive 2000/25/EC. The directive is urgent, because it has an impact on the period that began on 1 January 2011, and it is highly significant in view of the positive results it is expected to bring to the sector in question. A maximum level of emissions is laid down in the directive for each type of tractor on the basis of engine performance, and a gradual reduction in emissions is stipulated in multiple phases. The limits set for the stage that has just begun are much stricter than for the previous stage. In the interests of easing the transition between these stages, the directive introduces a system of flexibility, allowing tractor makers to market a limited number of tractors with engines calibrated to the emission limits allowed in the previous stage. The directive proposed by the Commission should be warmly welcomed. It takes account of environmental objectives approved by the EU some time ago. If the proposed amendment is not approved, we would paradoxically end up with the precise opposite, since many farmers might decide to stick with their old, polluting tractors, thus causing environmental deterioration in Europe. I therefore think that it is desirable to support the amendment to the directive, because approval would bring about the aim of environmental protection, while also promoting the economic prospects of the branch of industry in question.
costep_2003-09-24_3_146	I abstained from voting on compromise Amendment No 7 and I disagree with paragraph 30 of the motion for a resolution. I believe that it is a mistake to say that 'draft Constitution prepared by the Convention () expresses the will of the citizens'. The will of the citizens will only be effective once the Constitution has been ratified by a referendum of the people at European level. Furthermore, I supported Amendment No 78, which expresses unhappiness at the draft Constitution’s inclusion in part III, unamended, of all the articles of the Maastricht Treaty dealing with the Union’s economic and monetary policy, which are founded on the principle of 'an open market economy with free competition' (Article III-70 of the draft Constitution). I believe that this amendment is crucial to fully guarantee the content of Article 3 of the draft Constitution, which suggests that the Union is founded on a 'social market economy, highly competitive and aiming at full employment and social progress'. On the issue of public services I supported Amendment No 82, which calls for public services to be exempted from the rules of Community competition law. Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1 of the Rules of Procedure)
costep_2009-03-23_14_7	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this lengthy debate here today, I should like to take a few moments, if you would allow me, to reflect on the road we have travelled until now. Let us remember the initial positions of some Members of this Parliament in the face of increasing concern in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, in the face of demonstrations against the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), in the face of warning signals from NGOs from the North as well as the South, when we were demanding that the priority in these agreements should be development, something that seems obvious today, as the Commission is constantly repeating it. Mr Mandelson, however, at the time, scarcely dared to answer us because, for him, it was primarily a matter of stimulating trade, as if simply removing customs barriers would somehow miraculously bring about development. People called us idealists, manipulated by the NGOs, and were offended by our demands for instruments for protection, regulation and intervention by public authorities, but what happened? It appeared that we were not being irresponsible. No, the governments of the ACP countries did not accept continuing negotiations under pressure or threats. No, the risks involved in opening up trade are not an attitude of mind, they are real and will have real and immediate consequences: state budgets will be reduced through loss of customs revenues, new industries in the agricultural sector will be weakened and the food security of their people put at risk. We were expressing these fears a long time ago, before the hunger riots or the financial crisis. So, what is to be said about the situation today? The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United Nations recognise that developing countries, contrary to what was said at the outset, will be seriously affected by the global recession. Jacques Diouf, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, emphasised this recently, asking whether we would dare to say to those we call partners that we are prepared to spend billions to save the global banking system but not to save their people who are dying of hunger. I want to be completely honest, Commissioner, and I wish this to be quite clear. If you do not make a strong and precise commitment on behalf of the Commission to give us a guarantee that the EPAs will be genuinely pro-development, I will not vote for assent. Words will not be enough and nor will declarations of intent, we have heard too much of those. We want specific commitments and I would like to list them one by one. The EPAs will not be satisfactory agreements unless they promote regional integration and contribute to development in the ACP countries and to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. When we call for the promotion of regional integration, that needs to be translated into practical terms. For example, in Central Africa, Cameroon has been criticised, not to say strongly condemned, by its neighbours, for having signed this interim agreement with the European Union. Out of the eight countries in the region, I note that five are Least Developed Countries, that is, countries that, automatically and fully in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organisation, have free access to the European market for exports without any requirements for trade concessions in return. I can quite understand their concerns when the Commission asks them to open up to 80 % of European exports. Therefore, if the Commissioner makes a commitment to promoting regional integration, if she makes a commitment to greater flexibility so as to take into account the different levels of development of our partners, perhaps she can tell us why she does not accept the offer of 71 % liberalisation proposed by Central Africa? The second fundamental subject for which we are awaiting a response concerns the Singapore Issues. These cannot be imposed in the negotiations against the wishes of the partner countries. On this point, I want particularly to emphasise public procurement. Of course, there must be transparency - I shall always defend that - but can we deprive our ACP partners of an essential instrument of their sovereignty in supporting their industry and their local services by imposing liberalisation of public procurement? The third point is services. In our discussions about EPAs with Cameroon, the Commission stressed time and again that our partners wanted to negotiate about services. That may be true, but, nonetheless, beware of those who would use this argument to impose liberalisation of services on all regions and all countries, and especially to justify liberalisation of public services. Commissioner, I expect a firm commitment from you that public services will remain outside the scope of the negotiations, in all regions. We know that the loss of customs revenue will cause a reduction in the budgets of our partners. If revenues are reduced, the first sectors to suffer will be sectors such as education, health or research. It would, therefore, be unacceptable for the ACP governments in this context to lose control of their public services and I call upon the Commissioner to give us her firm assurance on these issues. The fourth point, and this has already been mentioned, is that food security must be protected. This involves not only putting in place adequate safeguards, but also allowing our partners to sustain their exports in order to remain competitive in global markets. I know that there have been some positive developments in this direction in the Southern African Development Community region. Is the Commission prepared to propose similar measures in other regions? The last point is that we know that upgrading the economies of ACP States will require a huge financial commitment from the European Union both to protect infant industries from the negative effects of liberalisation and to develop the competitiveness of our partners' economies. Unfortunately, contrary to the repeated recommendations of our political group, it is the European Development Fund that is to be used as the primary source of funding for the EPAs. We know that in the past the Commission has not been outstanding in the way it makes use of these funds, and I must, therefore, stress how important it is for these funds to be used quickly and according to the priorities of our partners. Finally, Commissioner, these agreements are the image that the European Union will give to the rest of the world, the image that the European Union will give to the poorest countries in the world.
costep_1998-07-13_4_3	Mr President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity, very commendably and notwithstanding the rules, to table a motion pursuant to Rule 129 of the Rules of Procedure, relating to the report by our colleague, Maria Berger; with strong support from our group she produced an excellent report on an extremely sensitive and difficult topic and submitted it for today’s sitting. However, following all the talks which Mrs Berger and I myself, as coordinator of our group, held in this House on the subject of the report, we do not see how we could achieve a majority vote for this report outside the Socialist Group. Therefore, pursuant to Rule 129, I request that you hold a vote on whether this report should be referred back to committee so that a discussion can take place there on how to proceed. I would justify this briefly by saying that for such a sensitive topic every effort should be made to sound out the possibilities of reaching a consensus. That is not possible today. Perhaps we will have this opportunity once again. Please ensure that Mrs Berger has this opportunity for her magnificent work.
costep_2002-12-18_3_100	Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the shipwreck of the Prestige has demonstrated the powerlessness of the European authorities and the various Member States when faced with a disastrous situation like this one which, although the coasts it has ravaged belong to Galicia, is nevertheless a European disaster and is felt to be so by all European citizens. It is precisely the European public, shocked at this appalling event, and the upset and fury of all those affected - particularly the wonderful Galician coastline and its communities - that are demanding that such a situation must not be allowed to happen again on our common coastline. It is the citizens that are hoping that Galicia will be given appropriate assistance by the EU. A committee of inquiry is required, in order to shed light on all the circumstances of the disaster and to determine responsibility so that we can learn lessons for the future. Europe’s citizens are demanding that legislation be made tougher, and that it enter into force and be implemented earlier than planned, without further ado. Protecting Europe’s maritime industry must increasingly be a common concern and therefore a common policy. Protecting the marine environment and the European coast are now major challenges for us all. If the tragedy of the Prestige serves to raise political consciousness and to stimulate action, the despair and the fury of the Galician people - and ours too - will not have been in vain.
costep_1997-06-10_3_29	Mr President, as opposed to the economic area of free trade initially set up, the rule of increasing Community regulation has prevailed once more, leading to the triumph of supra-national will. Since the second half of the 1980s, the growing desire for general harmonization called for the setting up of a socalled transitional VAT system that everyone knew was not appropriate. Transitional, but until when? The final system was due to be adopted by the Commission by 31 December 1994. It is now June 1997 and the taxation question is still on the agenda for harmonization. It is a delay but, above all, an admission of failure. This failure is all the more damning because it affects the main Community institutions, the Council and the Commission. This delay is now symbolized by two simple points. The first is that this transitional system is inappropriate and must be replaced and the second is the difficulty in setting up the final system. For that purpose, a certain number of ideas have been advanced, primarily that of replacing the destination country rule with the so-called country of origin rule. We are in agreement with this rule in principle as it would simplify administrative steps for companies. When you have fewer declaration obligations, you have fewer risks of error. A single declaration in a single taxation location means less possible fraud and cost savings. Where we disagree is when you recommend the pure and simple abolition of national exonerations and their replacement by zero rating. This is a further abandonment of our national sovereignty since it would be the Community institutions which would decide. Like all national taxes, direct or indirect, VAT is a priority instrument of budgetary policy. The proof is that since its appearance in France this unique tax has been copied worldwide. Yes, to the desire to change the current system but not at any price. No, to a further abandonment of sovereignty. We want to preserve our fiscal autonomy, which is not necessarily incompatible with a new VAT system in the European Communities.
costep_2000-10-04_7_25	Opening up the European Union to new members will increase stability and wellbeing on the continent we share. It is therefore very positive that accession negotiations with all applicant countries have made progress. The applicant countries must be able to join the European Union according to the headway they have made. In the talks, therefore, the principle of differentiation must be applied. Bunching the applicant countries geographically and staggering their accession dates according to regional criteria are unacceptable. Enlargement will also benefit the present members of the European Union. Its political and macro-economic benefits will be greater than the additional costs the Member States will incur. The EU already benefits from the growing surplus in trade with the applicant countries. It is to be hoped that the governments of the applicant countries will continue strengthening their administrative capacity so that the EU’s acquis communautaire can be implemented in these countries prior to accession. Estonia’s rapid progress in preparing for membership is especially positive for Finland. Our neighbouring country has struggled with determination over the last decade to meet the criteria of membership. With respect to the question of Estonia’s minorities, the important language law, which was passed in June 2000, is in accordance with all international norms. Furthermore, the economic transition process has been a positive one. A speedy solution to the questions that remain is to be hoped for from the point of view of all parties. The government of Estonia should pay added attention to the fight against corruption and drug trafficking.
costep_2002-05-30_4_100	The initiatives of the Spanish Government are remarkable. Its priorities not only include granting maximum scope to fisheries, moderating environmental measures, re-routing the River de Ebro to Murcia or the annexation of Gibraltar, but evidently also the organisation of oppressive violence. With an EU institute for police studies, an EU incentive for private security services and cross-border protection of eminent persons, it is starting to resemble a feudal dictatorship modelled on South American traditions. In South America, politicians, officials, the military and important entrepreneurs hide behind walls, fences and armed guards. These screen them as much as possible from the ordinary public whom they provoke, while legislation underpins their self-appointed isolation. Instead of solving the problems for everyone, only the problems of the rich and powerful are solved, while the problems for everyone else, namely the vast majority of the population, only escalate. Are we in the EU acquiring legislation of a similar kind, in which European security rules are becoming more important than small-scale experiences at national or regional level? The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is right to note that an EU network should not determine the number of armed officials to be deployed or the level of priority to be given to escorts of prominent people in traffic, and it is also rejecting the other Spanish proposals to a large extent.
costep_1997-04-10_6_9	Mr President, my dear colleagues, the common resolution which is before us is not appropriate, for several reasons, in my opinion. First of all, it prejudges the outcome of current negotiations, while the European Union awaits an imminent response from the government of Belarus on the concerns which it has expressed. It appears that the government of Belarus is currently quite prepared to take account of the recommendations of the European Union. By adopting this resolution today, we would be making a mistake detrimental to the responsible image which our parliament must show. Secondly, the draft treaty between Belarus and Russia can only be analysed within the much wider scope of the re-structuring of the CIS, a problem which cannot be put to one side, but which is nevertheless completely forgotten in the common resolution. This treaty creates a union open to other states; it proposes a level of cooperation greater than that of the CIS and also, at the more involved level of the four way cooperation between Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. It is necessary, therefore to put things back into context. Thirdly, the common resolution seems to me to be rather devalued, it is no secret, by the presence, among the signatories, of Communists, who are not the best placed to give lessons in basic freedoms and the fight against totalitarianism. Finally, it is ridiculous to speak of a government which consulted the people by referendum on 27 November 1996. Since when has an autocracy carried out referenda? In the whole of the history of Russia, I have never seen an autocrat carry out referenda. It is enough to refer to the history books. It would be preferable to postpone the vote on this common resolution, or failing that, not to adopt it. The situation is really in the process of improving thanks to diplomatic discussions and I believe that hysterical or unilateral speeches coming from this chamber cannot but create a climate of mistrust between East and West, which will really do nobody any good.
costep_2000-03-16_8_3	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time that we have dealt with the problem of organised crime in the European Union and there is a specific reason why we are doing so today in an urgent debate: the murder in Brindisi on 24 February of two officials of the Guardia di Finanza has again suddenly brought to light the danger faced by our colleagues in the security bodies of the Member States whose job is to protect the external borders of the European Union or work in regions which, because they are adjacent to the external borders of the European Union, are breeding grounds for organised crime. Our colleagues in the public police departments do not only deserve our full solidarity and respect; above all, we owe it to them to acknowledge once and for all that, wherever we live in the European Union, officials of the Guardia di Finanza in Apulia, for example, and I say this as a German member of parliament, are protecting the territory and the citizens of my country. I think that we in this European Parliament owe it to the relatives of the victims to acknowledge that respect for the dead is not an Italian but a European matter. That is the first point which I wished to make here. The second is a political challenge which, in my view, we are not taking seriously enough. We talk of the need to combat organised crime efficiently and yet we too frequently overlook the fact that the European internal market which we ourselves have created, with freedom of movement of services, capital, goods and persons, has created a huge free zone of economic activity in which, wherever legal transactions can be freely conducted, illegal transactions can also be freely conducted. In creating this huge legal economic area, we have also created a huge illegal economic area and it is now possible to operate on a large scale throughout the whole of Europe for the purposes of smuggling, trafficking in human beings, credit card fraud, drug trafficking, prostitution and every other possible form of serious crime. However, the police counter-strategies needed still mainly come within the jurisdiction of the nation states. The instruments to fight organised crime are organised at intergovernmental level. Where I live, in the district of Aachen, there is a town called Herzogenrath. The Netherlands are on one side of the street and Germany is on the other and if you rob a bank on the German side and escape to the Dutch side in time, then you are lucky because no German police is allowed to follow you. This is a practical example of the difficulties inherent in the fight against organised crime and clearly illustrates the need for a cross-border, or rather a pan-European approach. The point I wish to make is that, when it comes to serious crime which can only be combated at a pan-European level, the European Union needs independent operational powers for the European police agencies under the control of the European Parliament. I think that, as politicians in the Council, the Commission and Parliament, we owe it to those who fall victim to increasing organised crime to create the instruments needed to fight organised crime efficiently.
costep_2011-05-11_6_188	This report is aimed at extending exceptional, unlimited, duty-free access to the EU market for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the so-called stabilisation and association process. The pretext of this is to revitalise the Western Balkan economies through privileged access to the EU market, in the belief that any economic growth resulting from this will foster political stability throughout the region. These measures cannot, however, be considered in isolation from the situation of severe economic and social crisis that exists today in the Balkans, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo. The current crisis in this region is part of the wider crisis of capitalism and is being aggravated by its impact: however, it is deeply rooted in a long history of interference, aggression and military occupation, promoted by the EU and its main powers, and the US, seeking to impose their economic and political dominance. The secession of Kosovo and the role of the EU in this are indicative of that, and the internal process dubbed 'reform and transition' represents the current stage of this process of the imposition of imperial rule over the region.
costep_2009-09-15_3_7	Mr President, may I first of all congratulate Mr Šemeta on the confirmation obtained yesterday of his appointment as Commissioner responsible for the budget. We are convinced that we will enjoy the same quality of relations with him as those which we established with his predecessor, and we wish him a political career that is as brilliant as that of Mrs Grybauskaitė. Mr President, we are going through a period of global crisis, of preparation for major diplomatic events and of institutional uncertainty within the Union itself. In a period such as this, the Committee on Budgets will seek to adopt a cooperative attitude. As our rapporteur said, we regret the cuts made by the Council in the Commission’s proposals but, at the same time, we understand that the state of the Member States' public finances prevents them from going much further this year. For the 2010 budget, as has been said, we have an obligation to produce results: namely, balancing the financing of the 2010 section of the recovery plan. We know that redeployments will be necessary, but they must not focus on other political priorities previously decided on together by Parliament and by the Council. Beyond 2010, Parliament will hope to undertake work jointly with the Commission, the Council, the Swedish Presidency and the future Spanish Presidency on three major issues for the future. If, of course, things turn out as we hope in Ireland, the first issue will be the implementation of the procedure, schedule and working methods required by the application of the Treaty of Lisbon. The second issue will be the mid-term review of the financial perspective. Between the joint decision on the multiannual financial framework taken in May 2006 and now, there has been the financial crisis, the very strong pressures on the price of energy, raw materials and even foodstuffs, and the negotiations on climate change. There has also been - I am sorry to say - the failure of the Lisbon Strategy, as is plain to see today. It is therefore a thorough review of our multiannual guidelines that we need. This will be the first task of the new Commission. Lastly, the third and final issue will be the reform of the resources that make up the European budget. We knew before the crisis that none of the Member States wanted to pay for Europe’s spending any more. Since the crisis, none of the Member States can pay for this spending any more. Our financial contribution to the economic recovery will represent scarcely 0.03% of the Union’s GDP. We are fully aware of the extreme difficulty of the issue, but the European Parliament started work on it four years ago with the national parliaments, and it intends to put itself in a position to propose some areas of work so as to launch the debate next year.
costep_2002-03-20_3_66	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we have a paper from the Commission on the table, on which I merely wish to say that I am astonished time and again by the consummate skill with which Commission officials can fill twenty-eight pages without saying anything of real substance. This at least has the strategic advantage of ensuring that they cannot subsequently be compelled to honour their commitments. May I say, Commissioner De Palacio, that these remarks naturally do not apply to the chapters for which you are responsible but to other chapters in this and other papers. Nevertheless, this is what we have now, and so I believe we ought to comment on it. As far as the single market is concerned, I can say on the basis of my experience of past years in this House that we are still far from having a single market which works truly effectively in every area. Major deficits still exist. I believe that the Commission should focus on the elimination of these deficits as one of its top priorities for 2003. In the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we have just been debating the Directive concerning the distance marketing of consumer financial services at second reading stage. It has emerged once again that insurance services are one of those areas in which there is still no functioning single market but only compartmentalised national markets. As I said, there are still considerable deficits. The Commission’s reports have shown that we have the same problem in other sectors of the economy too with the implementation of freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment. We have a report from the Commission that has already been discussed in committee and will no doubt soon have further repercussions, a report which deals with specific deficits in the realm of freedom to provide services. Time does not permit me to go into the various specific examples, but I would urge the Commission to continue the systematic pursuit of this approach and to ensure that we ultimately have a genuine functioning single European market. Let me mention one last point that was also discussed this morning at the meeting with members of the national parliaments. In January, Parliament adopted a report on further steps towards convergence in the realm of civil and commercial law. May I ask the Commission, and especially the Commissioners with the relevant portfolios, to forge ahead with these efforts and to present a Green Paper or White Paper as soon as possible to give us a firm idea of the direction in which we are heading. This, I believe, is quite crucial as a means of ensuring that the single market not only exists and operates to the advantage of big business but that consumers and smaller businesses also have the opportunity to make full use of the options offered by the single market. We are building the single market first and foremost for the people of Europe, not for the sole benefit of large companies. Hence my plea to forge ahead with increased vigour and increased energy, even in the face of the opposition which, as experience shows, is always encountered in some Member States.
costep_1999-01-28_1_32	The Swedish Social Democrats are in favour of three overall objectives for agricultural and food policy in the EU. Firstly, agricultural and food production should be driven by consumer demand; secondly, production should be sustainable in the long term, both ecologically and economically; and thirdly, the EU should be contributing towards worldwide food security, for example by ensuring that the principles of free trade are upheld in the agriculture and food sectors. Free trade should, however, be compatible with the interests of consumers, animal protection and regional and environmental policy. We think that in the long term, both restrictions on production and subsidies under the COMs should be phased out. The financial resources thus released could be used for investment in regional industrial development, infrastructure, rural development and environmental services, which may well be necessary as a result of reform. In the long term, agriculture - like other sectors - will generally have to operate on the basis of market conditions. During a transitional period, however, temporary support may be required to enable the adjustments to be made in a way that is acceptable from a social point of view. Well-defined measures are needed in order to meet the vitally important environmental goals, as well as to promote rural and regional industrial development. We are also convinced that the reduction and eventual abolition of market support measures and better adaptation to free market principles will lead to a reduction in the cost of the agricultural policy. In order to achieve this goal, some additional pressure on the EC budget, of a temporary nature, may be acceptable. In the long run, however, there will be a reduction in agricultural spending. We regard this as an urgent matter, since it would facilitate the forthcoming enlargement of the Union towards the east.
costep_2002-02-28_4_13	I would like to make three comments with regard to the financing of the Convention that will prepare for the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference. Firstly, the representatives from the Member States have succeeded in putting together a complicated arrangement, when it could have been much simpler; secondly, this complexity will backfire on them; and thirdly, it will be so much harder to implement because essential expenditure has visibly not been included. First and foremost, the interests of simplicity and logic dictate that, to finance the Convention, Member States should have created a fund financed directly from their own contributions and controlled by themselves: the Convention is, in effect, a unique body, set up outside the Treaties as part of an intergovernmental process in preparation for an Intergovernmental Conference. Instead of this, they have formulated a complicated procedure, under the terms of which funds are partly financed by the Community institutions, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, pursuant to an 'interinstitutional agreement' that gives the aforementioned the right to examine Convention expenditure. For example, Article No 20 of the basic decision states that discharge of the Fund’s expenditure can only be granted by the Member States after the three institutions have given their assent; Article No 6 of the agreement states that these institutions should be regularly informed of the implementation of expenditure; Article No 4 states that any increase must be authorised by them. This complicated arrangement gives the institutions a means of influencing the Convention’s expenditure, and therefore the way in which it functions and, lastly, its decisions, There is no doubt at all that this power, if used effectively, will be used against the Member States. Finally, there will be plenty of opportunities for conflict, for it already seems that the total budget for the Convention (EUR 10.5 million for the first ten months), has been underestimated. In fact, the working conditions of the various parliamentary representatives - the European Parliament, the national parliaments of the Member States and the national parliaments of the candidate countries, are quite unequal, and this three-speed system, in which the European Parliament is disproportionately privileged, will, in all fairness, prove untenable. We therefore need to provide additional resources to the other two categories, or at least to the third. Report Mayol i Raynal A5-0461/2001
costep_2010-04-21_5_12	I would like to recall that, contrary to earlier negative expectations that preceded Parliament’s negative vote, there have, in fact, been several positive developments as well, and it seems that there will be a better than expected agreement between the European Union and the United States; if all goes well, it will be concluded by the summer. Since that time, it has first of all become clear to us that the US is far more open to these reservations and to finding constructive solutions to the European reservations than we had previously thought. I think that we have all found that cooperation is better and the dialogue between the Council and Parliament is closer, and I think it is also important that Commissioner Cecilia Malmström regularly informs the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs of the developments. I think this is the key to ensuring that good agreements do indeed continue to be reached in the future. I think it is important to state this, before going any further. I, too, would like to say what several people have emphasised, namely that Parliament is committed, and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats is also very seriously committed to securing an agreement as soon as possible, and to making sure that this is a good agreement, in other words, one that takes into account the interests of European citizens, including their data protection interests. We know and we feel the responsibility, since this is a very important element in combating terrorism, even if it is not the only or even the most important element, but this particular data exchange is very important. It seems to us that the mandate in its present state provides solutions to many problems but leaves many others without a solution. As yet, there is no solution to problems such as those mentioned earlier by our colleagues and which will be the subject of further discussion today. I think that these two weeks, which are available to us because of the postponement of the vote due to the problems with flying, present us with an opportunity; an opportunity to find solutions to the outstanding problems and to find answers to those questions and reservations raised by Parliament to which we have not yet found reassuring answers. It would be good if Council did not reach a decision before Parliament has had a chance to vote, since that could cause further difficulties in the near future.
costep_1999-05-03_11_9	Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, although the Committee on Development and Cooperation has to grant discharge for the European Development Fund each year, it does not have any influence on how this fund is used because it has not so far been integrated into the budget. Governments have repeatedly signalled, before taking up the Council presidency, that they might be able to support integrating it into the budget. Later, however, numerous reasons have been found for postponing this decision after all. One of the committee’s specific criticisms of the 1997 budget is that large amounts are transferred from one Development Fund to the next. The suggestion is therefore being made to simplify the management of appropriations. With regard to the appropriations for cofinancing, the committee also criticises the fact that individual projects take too long to complete and that the supply of funds in particular often causes huge problems for the non-governmental organisations. The Court of Auditors and the Development Committee are waiting rather anxiously to see whether the new structures which the Commission is now introducing will prove to be effective here. That is why the Committee on Development and Cooperation requests that a report should be submitted to it next March on experiences with the new structures. The committee also takes the view that the response to the procedural shortcomings criticised by the Court of Auditors should be for a minimum degree of competition to be required, in particular in the tendering and award procedures. Nevertheless, the committee agrees with granting discharge for the 1997 Development Fund. Development cooperation is not one of the areas which voters immediately see as an essential part of European policy. We are therefore all the more dependent on financial resources being used transparently and in a way which people can understand.
costep_1999-01-27_11_7	Mr President, first I would like to express the support and appreciation of my group for the Commission’s initiative designed to improve the Community’s legislative framework for public procurement. As has already been mentioned, this is an enormously important area of activity, representing over 10 % of the Union’s GDP. There are many innovations, an ambitious timetable has been proposed, and naturally we hope the various measures can be implemented smoothly. There are two points I want to make: the first is to explain why I have tabled Amendment No 1 to paragraph 30, which is about making the competitive dialogue procedures more widely available. I have to say that I am opposed to the possibility of post -tendering negotiations because even if they could be done transparently - and I find that hard to believe as there does not seem to be much point to them beyond publicity as an end in itself - surely such negotiations would damage parity of conditions, given that only the successful tenderer would enjoy its results. That is what is behind Amendment No 1. I also tabled Amendment No 2, but I hereby withdraw it so obviously I shall not dwell on it. That just leaves Amendment No 1 from me. At a general level, I want to take this opportunity to emphasise the need to make the tender procedure more transparent at European level, both procedurally and in terms of the dissemination of information. This laudable initiative must not prejudice the need to simplify and remove some of the red tape, as my colleague Mrs Peijs and others have already said, particularly with a view to further integrating small and medium-sized firms into the single market.
costep_1997-06-10_3_11	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s joint debate, opened by the chairman of the European Monetary Institute, Mr Lamfalussy, for which I recognize the hard work and good relations that Dr Lamfalussy has maintained with the European Parliament in particular (last year it was my honour to draft the report on the first report by his institution), comes really at a key moment. We are facing a new element of uncertainty created after the position expressed yesterday by France at the ECOFIN meeting and one week away from the Amsterdam summit, which should lead us to a new Treaty. I think that an important conclusion of this debate would be for the European Parliament to consolidate, strengthen and very clearly insist on the need for EMU to come about and the euro to be introduced in the planned conditions and timescales. I think that any element of uncertainty could lead to greater difficulties, in an economic situation in which gradual recovery is taking placer, as is shown by the development of the European economy in the last quarter and the Commission’s own forecasts, which we debated here for this year and next, and that should offer an appropriate economic framework for fulfilling this project. This project, as you know, also has a very important political dimension for the achievement of European Union. I should like to insist that this moment in time is not the most appropriate for asking institutions such as the European Monetary Institute or the future European Central Bank to implement policies that do not fit them. The Institute and, later, the Bank, must guarantee conditions of stability and solvency, with low levels of inflation and interest rates, offering a credible framework that is both secure and solvent internationally. Then, if the governments and administrations implement economic policies in a framework of competence, we shall be able to solve the most serious problem facing European society: unemployment. We cannot ask these institutions to solve what has to be done by the other administrations and the governments, when their electoral promises turn out to be more satisfactory, in the short term, from the electoral point of view.
costep_2008-03-12_3_5	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin with an observation to the President of the Council. We have been informed, Sir, that the Mediterranean Union is to be discussed at tomorrow’s dinner. This is an idea of the French President, and at the talks over dinner - as well as hoping that all the participants enjoy their meal - I would ask you on behalf of our Group to clarify the following. If the idea is that the Mediterranean Union will build on, or upgrade, the Barcelona process into which we are pumping a good deal of money out of the European Union budget, then we are fully in favour of it. However, there need to be guarantees that such a policy will be pursued within the framework of the European Union. If the Mediterranean Union is to be a success, it must be a Community policy within the framework of the existing EU institutions and policies. If, conversely, the Mediterranean Union were to become a divisive factor in the EU, then that would be a bad sign; it would moreover isolate France on the eve of the French Presidency, something we certainly do not want. Applause We therefore ask you to pass on this message to the participants at the summit. Not altering the guidelines is one thing. The decision taken here on 20 February by a majority of 515 votes, namely to alter them, is quite a different matter. However, let us not argue about whether or not to alter the guidelines; let us discuss whether or not the substantive changes contained in our demand for the guidelines to be altered are practicable. Mr Barroso, I criticised you last week for demonstrating a lack of commitment. I have heard in the meantime that some Members of your Commission - presumably after consultation with you - have taken up and put forward some of the ideas that we proposed here. Hence my criticism on this point is no longer relevant. However, Mr President of the Commission, having heard your speech today I must repeat the following: you have a guiding role in Europe. Your words to the Heads of State and Government tomorrow must encourage them to put what you have just been calling for into practice in the Member States. A good deal of what you say is true, naturally, but we need to address the real situation in Europe. Allow me therefore to list five points which we believe remain crucial but have not been sufficiently flagged up or put into practice. Yes, progress has of course been made: unemployment is falling and productivity rising, yet job insecurity in Europe is rising too. That is also a fact. Of course more jobs are being created, but the jobs being created are not secure; they are ever more insecure. Pay rises in Europe are not keeping pace with company profits: in percentage terms, company profits are outstripping pay rises for workers. Applause This represents a social imbalance. We wish to improve social cohesion; we want more social protection. What is the point of a growing internal market, what is the point of a globally competitive Union, if the reality is this: a manufacturing company makes a 4% profit at a site and says 'this is not enough for the shareholders; they want a 6% profit, so we are closing down the company at this site'. That strikes a blow against the basic confidence that the European Union needs. Our citizens must have confidence! We are discussing unbundling in the energy sector, which might or might not be necessary. Let us talk for once about an unbundling that is taking place in the social policy field in Europe. There is a real danger that economic growth will become uncoupled from social security, which is why the guidelines need to be revised. We must make plain that whatever happens in the social policy field in the European Union goes hand in hand with economic progress. We are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the European Parliament this afternoon. According to the spirit that prevailed here in Strasbourg 50 years ago, the combination of economic development and social security was the basis for the European Community’s growth and success. It is increasingly being put at risk. You say that red tape must be cut for small and medium-sized enterprises. Yes! However, if red tape is cut and such companies move around Europe and then produce a case such as the Laval case, that strikes a blow against confidence in the European Union. For if freedom of movement can be used even by SMEs to roll back social progress, companies may stand to gain but their employees will not. Those employees, however, make up the vast majority of EU citizens. Of course we need investment in education, training, research and technical innovation. That goes without saying. However, if, for the overwhelming majority of people, access to university or school is dependent on whether their parents have enough money in their wallets, then that is not a social policy. We need equal access for all citizens in the European Union, wherever they come from and whatever their family circumstances. If Europe is to survive, we must strengthen that potential, not only business potential. We must above all strengthen the potential of young people on this continent who need access to research, skills and training. It undoubtedly strikes a blow against social confidence if any rich person in Europe can take their money coffers from one country to another without having to pay tax. That is another blow! You are therefore right to say that we need to regulate the EU’s financial markets. All of this, Mr President, argues in favour of a revision of the guidelines. Ultimately it matters little whether or not we call it that. If you convey this message to the Council tomorrow, we will be on your side; but we will only be on your side if you do so, Mr President! Applause
costep_2011-05-11_11_5	Madam President, I would first like to thank Mrs Liotard, Mr Pittella, Mr Leinen, and the entire negotiating team. Thanks to them, we have maintained an extremely cohesive position throughout this very lengthy trialogue and I think that the only positive aspect of the dossier is that the European Parliament has been united in defending public health and the interests of consumers. That is what we have been elected for and not for anything else. While I recognise the need to move forward and not to assign blame, there is no getting away from the facts, and when it came to conducting negotiations in which Parliament had already abandoned a great deal, well, that was too much. As if we should even be asking ourselves whether or not to label products sold on the European market when the consumer’s freedom of choice is fundamental in European law! What has happened is totally unacceptable and we have been fobbed off with spurious pretexts. We have been presented with legal excuses. We were not entering into a commercial war; the rules of the WTO were not being violated. In legal terms, this was all untrue. Not being able to label is an excuse. It is technically incorrect. It is perfectly possible to label and trace. Simply, it was something we were unwilling to do because, as Mr Leinen pointed out just now, we put interests other than those of consumers first. So, now, we need to move forward, and we need to move forward quickly. The issue of cloning is increasingly being used by all who want to call the European institutions into question. It is an argument put forward by those who mistrust our institutions. It is an argument put forward by those who mistrust the foods placed on the European market. For pity’s sake, we urgently need to adopt a clear position on cloning to prevent cloned meat and the offspring of cloned animals being placed on the European market, which is what European consumers and European citizens want!
costep_1998-12-16_6_13	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say a few words at the end of a century that has witnessed so many massacres and attempts to exterminate different peoples on the European continent. Without preaching to anyone, and as our colleague Mr Swoboda said a few moments ago, we undoubtedly have a few things to say to the rest of the world. Yet what point is there in us boasting, we who are the world’s largest trading power, if, as we speak, a man is suffering in the depths of a prison or perhaps a women is being killed? We could say a few words here on the body of doctrines that we have built for ourselves over the past 50 years, and in particular over the past 10 years. Yet what purpose would it serve if, as an industrial power and irrespective of our country of origin, we are not in fact capable of saying: 'we will no longer work with you if you do not put a stop to these massacres, if you do not stop torturing people and, as a result, you will not be able to work with even the smallest business in Europe'? If we cannot say this - and it is neither interventionism nor a moral dictatorship -, then we are not what the eyes of the world perceive us to be: the hard core of democracy. How many democracies exist in the world today? There are not, at any rate, many more than double the number of countries in the Union, that is, fifteen countries. This demonstrates precisely what our duties are. I believe that we should take heart in the fact that we have today welcomed a number of men and women who have fought for freedom, who are currently speaking in another room. As I finish speaking, let us simply remember that such freedom is fragile and can disappear in a puff of smoke.
costep_2009-03-25_9_19	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, () with satisfaction of Belarus' new willingness to collaborate with the European Union and the international community. We are very cautious in our dealings with President Lukashenko, but a new direction in this area is welcome. We will not tire of pointing out the need for a comprehensive and substantial shift in relation to respect for human rights. On one point I believe that the Commission could require clearer and more consistent behaviour from Minsk: I refer to the situation of the tens of thousands of children who stay with European families for a few months. For many years, the Belarusian Government has acted absurdly, sometimes incomprehensibly, often cancelling children’s visits at the last minute, mortifying the host families and giving another loud slap in the face to children who, often orphans from somewhat complicated family backgrounds, resented the whole affair. Let us try and come to a change of course on this as soon as possible.
costep_2003-05-13_2_55	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking today on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to submit my opinion on the issue of comitology. In so doing - and this was of course mentioned at the end of the previous intervention - I am focusing in particular on the Lamfalussy process and the Lamfalussy procedures for legislation creating the internal market in financial services. Like the Lamfalussy Group, our aim is to produce legislation in this sector that is close to the market and practicable; that is what all of us want and are working for. However, we must of course take a close look at what form the procedures may take in the future. Precisely in our role as Parliament we need to ask ourselves whether the future procedures also have sufficient democratic legitimacy, because of course we are also getting increasing numbers of so-called soft laws, that is legislation at international level. I only need to mention Basel II or the International Accounting Standards, which will soon become law in Europe once the necessary steps have been taken by the European Commission and after adoption in the Council and Parliament. If in the future all of this were to happen in a comitology procedure, with a framework directive only giving general instructions, we would have a basic problem of legitimacy, and Parliament reserves the right to have a say on these very important issues in the future. For this reason I can only support the rapporteur, Mr Corbett. It is vital for us in the European Parliament to retain our influence at European level. This does not mean that we also wish to discuss the technical details in the plenary or in committee. That is not our point. But if we feel that provisions are heading in the wrong direction it is vital that we be able to say so, and for this to happen it is essential that the constitution being drafted by the Convention give us a right to call back in the future, which means that if we are not happy with something we can recall it, change its focus and correct it. That is why it is essential for the Commission and the Convention to support us here so that we can have the relevant provisions added.
costep_2001-11-28_11_5	Mr President, we have long been calling for an increase in funds for AIDS given the appalling situation. The European Parliament has made its stance on this issue clear in voting for the Khanbhai report. We were naturally very encouraged by the decision to release a further EUR 120 million. However, the proposal put before us today, after some prevarication, only amounts to EUR 60 million. Furthermore, this will come from the existing budget. This is not extra money. These funds are not ongoing. We also wish to question the allocation of this money to a single international fund. What is the aim of this fund? Is it only for prevention? Or will it also provide access to treatment for people living in the countries of the South? Will it provide health care infrastructures and medicines? These are the questions we must ask. How will this fund be managed? How will those that need this money, namely the countries of the South, be involved in these decisions? It is not simply up to the donor countries. I think that we must ask ourselves all these questions because people are dying everyday, but we have money and it is up to us to help them.
costep_1998-05-27_5_19	Mr President, during this discussion, as the Chairman of the Catholic Workers' Movement in the Regensburg Diocese, I have found myself thinking of something that Cardinal Cardyns said: every single young worker is worth more than all the gold in the world. This is an old saying, but its message is still relevant. Jobs are important, but hitherto there has been too much talk, and here I would agree with my colleague Wim van Velzen, and not enough success. Now there are action plans. I only hope that they will be implemented quickly and successfully, otherwise even the best action plans will be of no use. Best practice is fine, but I hope that it is quickly adopted in those countries which have not hitherto adopted it. We are always hearing about assistance to SMEs but no Council Presidency and no Commission has yet been able to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises have simple requirements so that they, too, can put them into practice. Taxation and welfare systems should bring about a reduction in accessory costs to wages, but they must also be fair so that employees do not again bear the burdens alone. Structural reform, Agenda 2000 - Commissioner Santer, rural areas seem to me to have been treated very shabbily in this goulash Objective II. Something more has to be done in this area. As regards the environment, allow me to say that we need both people and nature, and not nature without people! I also have a question about the operation of the own resources system: why do we have no money for computers when at the same time we are giving away billions of marks in own resources? Perhaps for once you could do something about this. Please implement the social market economy as quickly as possible in the new accession countries so that we are not confronted there by problems which are the same as our own. Do not forget subsidiarity even if as a central government you sometimes are not so happy about it!
costep_2007-12-12_5_8	Ladies and gentlemen, I think I need hardly add that we, like all our colleagues, were quite appalled by the demonstration earlier. I would say this, however: 'Do not over-dramatise! There may be 50 nutcases in the chamber but there are 700 Members who oppose them, so do not inflate the fact that 50 lame-brains disrupted the signing ceremony into an affair of state. Let us calm down and, Graham, let us not insist that those responsible be thrown out. In my view, a free Parliament is a Parliament that can tolerate a few nutcases, irksome though they might be. Applause
costep_2010-01-19_7_16	In recent years, the European Union has greatly strengthened its relations and influence in the countries of the Near East. The European Union has always paid much attention to Iraq and, together with the international community, has participated both in the reconstruction of Iraq and in peacekeeping and security missions. Different groups are still struggling for power in the country, which hinders the implementation of reforms begun in the country in various areas. The fact that 14 parties are banned from participating in the elections that are taking place is also cause for concern. Iraq has chosen the road to democracy and therefore, both the European Union and other states must demand and, if necessary, help ensure that the international commitments entered into are observed and human rights and freedoms are respected. I believe that Iraq really is ready for close cooperation with the European Union. The Memorandum of Understanding between the EU and Iraq in the area of energy cooperation which was signed on Monday demonstrates its commitment to develop a long-term relationship that is mutually beneficial. From an energy point of view, Iraq is very important to the European Union, but safeguarding security of energy supply is inevitably linked to economic and political stability in the country, which has been lacking in recent times. Clearly, this is a long-term process, but I believe that the European Union, the High Representative and the international community must offer means and solutions to make the principles of human rights and the rule of law become the fundamental pillars of future politics in Iraq.
costep_2000-05-17_6_19	We must give our support to the interoperability of European railways as a means of revitalising and developing the sector at international level, in order better to meet users' needs, and also as an instrument for protecting the environment. Nevertheless, we do not feel that adequate solutions to the problems arising for those working in the sector as a result of this process have been provided in the texts before us. We are also aware, and are therefore bound to express our concern about this, that the proposals currently being discussed are part of a package of measures designed to liberalise the sector, and that the experiments that have already been carried out in this area have certainly led to a deterioration in safety and social conditions for workers. Savary report A5-0112/2000
costep_2009-11-11_17_12	Mr President, proper implementation of the Directive on services in the internal market is important not only for European entrepreneurs operating in that market, but also for consumers. The Services Directive is a good example. A period of three years has been allowed for its implementation. That is a long time, but even so, not all countries will manage to transpose the directive within the three years. This example shows most conspicuously that ideal cooperation between Member States and European institutions is needed in order to achieve transposition in time in all Member States. Indeed, this is the direction taken in the recommendations issued by the Commission in June this year concerning means for improving the functioning of the internal market. I think that in the implementation process, it is necessary to go a little further. Therefore, in the report concerning the table of results for the internal market, I propose the initiative of organising a forum for the internal market, which would bring together representatives of European institutions, Member States and other interested groups with the aim of achieving a more explicit commitment to transposition, so that we will be able to apply and execute legislation on the internal market, including this extremely important directive. I would like the forum to be a place for the exchange of experience of Member States and EU institutions in the area of transposition. I would like the forum to draw the attention of society to questions concerning the internal market. We must increase our citizens' interest in the functioning of and responsibility for the market. Then we will have achieved complete success. In connection with the problems which we heard about a moment ago concerning transposition of the Services Directive, I would like to ask if Member States have sought to cooperate with the Commission, and if it can be said that in the implementation process, they have succeeded in applying any of the Commission’s recommendations? Does the Commission continue to seek new solutions? Is it making use of all possibilities and means to mobilise and support especially those countries which are experiencing problems with transposition? Are there any new ideas on this matter?
costep_2010-11-25_9_316	Following the stalemate of the Copenhagen climate change conference, it is important that the European Union continues along the route it has taken up to this point in terms of making a serious commitment to sustainable development and trying to reduce carbon emissions without jeopardising European industry. However, any European commitment to reduce emissions cannot lose sight of economic efficiency or jeopardise the economic sustainability of the Member States, which are currently undergoing an unprecedented economic crisis. We cannot allow increased technology transfer to developing countries to be a way of addressing carbon leakage, and we cannot let policies designed to reduce CO2 emissions condemn European industry.
costep_2010-10-07_13_161	The highest levels of precaution, environmental protection and of safety and security of oil operations in Europe are principles of paramount importance on which we can accept no compromise. In particular, we have to draw the necessary conclusions from the catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico in order to prevent similar events from occurring in European Union maritime and coastal waters. Nonetheless, Parliament showed good sense today in rejecting the maximalist position calling for a moratorium on all new deep sea oil drilling in European waters. What is at stake is the survival and future of our European oil industry at a time of crisis, but also our need for energy independence.
costep_1998-02-18_10_9	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to talk about the second Le Rachinel report. The present proposal for a regulation remedies the lack of similarity between the separate national legislations. The Community model for the distinguishing sign of the Member State licensing of vehicles and trailers in internal Community traffic, let us call it the European nationality plate, is long overdue. Such a measure directly helps to include and raise the awareness of the citizens of the Union in the creation of an area without internal borders and to form and establish a feeling of European identity, while contributing indirectly to n increase in road traffic safety. In particular, the demand that the proposed Community sign must be located both at the front and at the back on the left beside the registration plate will be an advantage for the police and other administrative and judicial bodies. Although on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party I completely support Mr Le Rachinel’s report and thank him for his work, it seems to me personally that the Commission’s proposal for a regulation is not completely logical. Let us just consider: in a few weeks the third phase of European economic and monetary union begins, which will lead to a domestic market, the formal external appearance of which will be the single currency. What a magnificent achievement, proving our great farsightedness! With the distinguishing sign for vehicles and trailers the Europeans are failing to achieve logical standardization in the form of a common, standard design principle. Thus, with reference to the principle of subsidiarity, the EU Member States are obliged in fact to recognize the proposed Community model, but the validity of existing nationality plates remains completely unrestricted and continues to exist, independent of the Community model. There is not even a reference to the fact that in the Member States the Community model should preferably be used. In view of this fact, I could even understand if citizens from third countries were doubtful of the ability and/or seriousness of the efforts of EU to build a political union. For the vehicle owners of the Member States who have already accepted, on a compulsory or voluntary basis, the use of the Community model - it is of course not a new invention -, the present proposal for a regulation takes up a long-standing desire for legal certainty and is recognition - let us call it personal - of the costs they often willingly incurred when buying this combined vehicle registration plate. For me, too, it is desirable that third countries, above all the countries of the European Economic Area but also the associated countries of central and eastern Europe give legally binding recognition to the Community model. I recommend that we accept this report.
costep_2009-12-16_9_18	Madam President, I believe that we must try to come up with some simple ideas with regard to these very complicated matters. My first question is simple: Why did we go to Afghanistan? We went to Afghanistan with one objective: to dismantle the al-Qaeda training camps, the support base of international terrorism, which were threatening us and threatening stability in the region. Today, those camps no longer exist. My second observation is that, unfortunately, whether we like it or not, troops from the West deployed in Afghanistan are increasingly being regarded as occupation forces and no longer as friendly forces. This is a major, everyday problem that we must bear in mind. I invite those who tell you otherwise to go and see what is going on in that country. The third point is that the security situation has significantly deteriorated. In 2004, it was possible to walk around Kabul. Today, Kabul is a huge entrenched camp. Therefore, in failing to learn lessons from an operational failure on the ground and, ultimately, in applying only old methods, we are heading for a repeat of such failures. What are the consequences of all this? I believe, in fact, that it must be recognised that we have dismantled al-Qaeda - that is a genuine finding - and that we must pull out. Can we pull out straight away, today? No, because if we pulled out, it would undoubtedly cause chaos, and would perhaps lead to the return of those camps that we are combating. Our withdrawal must therefore come with some conditions attached. Firstly, as everyone says, we must hand over the keys to the Afghans themselves; we must ensure that the conflict is an Afghan conflict. Secondly, a dialogue must be established with all the insurgents, and note that I did not say 'with the Taliban', because the word 'Taliban' is very restrictive. Thirdly, a social level must be accepted that is not perfect. Let us not think that our European criteria are criteria that should be adapted to Afghanistan. We must accept that. Madam President, it is always more difficult to conclude a military operation than it is to start it, and in order to be able to conclude it, we must keep in mind the initial objective, which was to ensure that the al-Qaeda camps were dismantled. This has been done today.
costep_2008-04-24_6_16	Madam President, as my colleague has already mentioned, this report deals with who is responsible for what in the accountability process. Parliament’s role is quite significant, and I believe that we should have this function too. However, I would like to express some doubt regarding the consideration of every technical detail and establishing standards. I do not find the description of the method of assessment and evaluation of realisable and non-realisable assets completely acceptable. That is why I doubt we should interfere, whether this is good or a bad method. We should wait for the experts to carry out the assessment. Meanwhile, the review of the standard of non-realisable assets and consultations on this issue has already started. Only then should we make our decision. I therefore suggest that we do not support the proposal in Article 30(e) or that in Article 42.
costep_2007-05-21_15_8	Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his introduction and Mrs Vergnaud for her good cooperation. Since I have heard it said on several occasions that health services are not to fall within the scope of the Services Directive, I wonder what all this is about. The proposal that comprises the current article is the product of compromises that have been concluded, and due account has therefore been given to the condition on which the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe all insist, that being that health services should be included in the Services Directive as a lex specialis. Since, from what I gather, this has caused quite a commotion, I have tabled a replacement amendment which provides for what the Commissioner mentioned a moment ago. After all, the right balance should be struck between the free movement of services, respect for patients' rights, the freedom of practising a medical profession in Europe and the freedom of establishment. This is where the new amendment comes in, and I hope that the PSE Group and the PPE-DE Group can accept this, that we can adopt the amendment jointly, and that we will eventually end up with a fresh proposal which provides for equal treatment and solidarity for all Europeans, and I mean all Europeans, and all European patients. We must avoid a scenario where medical services are simply considered services of general interest, which means that they would be placed outside the scope of the European Treaty, with the effect that each Member State would again set up its own system, that borders would be closed, that there would be no freedom, that patients would not be recognised as having rights and that the rich would jet out to Peking to get the best treatment money can buy instead of seeking treatment in Europe. If that is what Europe sets out to do, then I think we are at risk of reverting back to the seventeenth century, which may have been a golden age, but does not, I think, represent what Europe is striving to be. I therefore hope that the amendment that has been tabled by the Liberal Group by way of replacement of Article 71 will meet with wide support, so that a separate directive for health services can be drawn up, and that all compromise amendments can be endorsed, which, in any event, they are by us, as the package is excellent. I hope that we will succeed in what we are setting out to achieve.
costep_1998-09-15_6_8	The Conciliation Committee is presenting a package of anti-pollution measures today which involves a series of important economic consequences. Thanks to Parliament’s efforts, three texts have been adopted. From these is derived a directive which is directly descended from the recent Auto-Oil programme, an operation which involved the Commission and the motor and oil industries as well as our Parliament. The priority objective today is to improve the quality of the air that we breathe, and that includes defining a European strategy for the reduction of vehicle emissions, through the launching, at long last, of absolutely clear Community legislation, which will consequently allow industry - especially the motor industry - to plan its sectoral investment with a view to the conversion needed to produce future generations of motor vehicles. The oil industry, with a kind of self-protective attitude, appears to exaggerate the cost of the investment it considers necessary to prepare the construction of new refineries, which it claims will be a direct burden on motorists. However, we believe that the establishment of rules which actually provide tax reductions for motorists - the main consumers in the sector - may in the end make the necessary investment possible. The agreement between the Council and Parliament will make it technically possible to improve the quality of the air, thanks to the compulsory provision for adding oxygen to diesel fuel, reducing the content of sulphur, benzene and aromatic substances in normal fuel and reducing emissions of anhydrous carbon. Under the terms of the directive, leaded fuel will no longer be on sale after the year 2000, except where climatic conditions are favourable to its use or where very serious economic damage might be caused. Furthermore, unleaded petrol and environmental diesel will have to obey stricter criteria as from January 2000. The terms envisaged are reasonably binding, especially as application will have to be made to the Commission, which will be very sparing in granting derogations and will only do so after duly justified requests and for a very limited period.
costep_2009-03-11_16_6	Madam President, I am, on the whole, pleased that this 5th World Water Forum is to be held in Istanbul and, above all, that the European Union is to participate with a delegation from the Commission, and also one from the European Parliament. I also understand and endorse the need to support the local public authorities in their attempts to establish democratic, participative systems and improvements or innovations in water management, and also to support decentralisation processes. The primary and fundamental aim of all this is to protect the fundamental right to water and sanitary services but, clearly, this must be within a rigorous framework of respect for sustainable development which, in the European Union, is set out in the Framework Directive on water as a reference point, with the Millennium Development Goals as the basis for development. I must say that all this - and I will set this out tomorrow in an amendment which I hope this House will adopt - was the subject of debate last autumn at the Zaragoza International Expo 2008 which, in addition, was the first time that the European Parliament participated alongside the Commission on equal terms. At the Expo, over 2 000 experts, in the Water Tribune, and NGOs, in the forum named the Agora, as well as the delegations from the Commission and Parliament, debated and generated an enormous volume of debate and very interesting, creative proposals on water management. This took on a permanent form in the '2008 Zaragoza Charter', adopted on 14 September 2008. This contains 17 points, some of which I would like to highlight. The Charter states: 'that access to drinking water and sanitation is a human right that must be guaranteed by all public authorities'; 'that access to water has an enormous influence on development'; 'that forecasts show that climate change is capable of modifying the availability and demand for water all over the planet'; 'that the sustainable production of food is directly linked to the efficient use of water'. 'that river basins are the best suited environments for harnessing water and their good management makes it possible to resolve conflicts between countries, regions and users'; and, finally, 'that the public authorities must take the initiative in promoting the legislation and arrangements required to ensure access to water by all'. I call upon the Commissioner to take into account the conclusions of the Zaragoza Charter, in the drafting of which we, the Commission and Parliament, participated, alongside experts, NGOs and associations, and that, in fact, it constituted a forum for preliminary debate in view of the 5th World Water Forum in Istanbul. I believe that it is worthwhile incorporating the conclusions of the Charter and also of the Water Tribune into the European discussion and debate materials that we, as the European Union, are displaying at the pavilion at this international expo.
costep_2006-06-15_1_117	Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, an agreement has been reached in a meeting of the Wine Management Committee to amend Regulations (EC) No 1622/2000, No 884/2001 and No 753/2002, with the aim of authorising the use of wood shavings to age wine. I wanted to table an oral question, with the support of more than 40 fellow Members, whom I should to thank, on the admissibility of this oenological practice, because I believe that Parliament must be able to express its opinion on an issue that is only outwardly technical but which actually raises some important issues relating to the quality and future of European wine. There was an attempt to justify this proposal by the need for us to fall in line with those non-European countries that already authorise this practice. I wonder, instead, whether the specific nature of European wine and its strength on the world market do not indeed lie in high quality and respect for traditional practices. Has the Commission assessed the impacts of this proposal on high-quality wines? What measures does it plan to adopt in order to ban this practice, at least for high-quality wines? As regards labelling, does the Commission regard the failure to mention this practice on labels as being compatible with our guidelines on transparency? Finally, what would happen during WTO negotiations if, instead of trying to raise standards relating to oenological practices, we lowered them? I should be grateful to the Commission if it would kindly shed some light on these points, not least in view of the next WTO reform of the wine sector.
costep_2011-05-12_13_87	I voted in favour of this report because it highlights how important it is for young people to have a multidisciplinary education, as far as the targets of the EU 2020 strategy are concerned. In this framework, it becomes necessary to encourage young people to continue their studies to university level. In fact, entering the world of work too early increases the risk of unemployment later on, and of a comparatively low standard of living. This could therefore have high economic and social costs, as well as a negative impact on the Union’s sustainable economic growth and on its ability to improve its global competitiveness in the future. For the same reasons, I believe that a multicultural, multilingual and practical education is essential for shaping the citizens of the future, especially if this is achieved by means of mobility schemes such as Youth on the Move.
costep_2010-05-19_7_1	Mr President, I have a high opinion of you and your chairmanship, but today I must make a protest. You have given the floor to many Members, including twice to Mr Lehne and to Mr Gollnisch and Mr Fox. I also raised a point of order concerning the calendar and it is an important point. I would like to ask you to check whether Amendment 4 was unlawful. I know that we rejected the amendment, but this is a question of principle. The treaty does not refer to 12 plenary sessions per year, but to 12 monthly plenary sessions per year. The amendment tabled by Mr Fox attempted to combine the August and the September plenary sessions in one week. This is not about a September I and September II plenary session, but about an August and a September plenary session. I would really like to clarify that this is unlawful.
costep_2000-11-17_3_2	Mr President, we have spoken today about the importance and unimportance of reports. I believe this is an important report, and I am therefore proud and happy that it is to be debated and voted upon on a Friday, for Friday is a working day like any other. I am of the view that, as a European Parliament, we can also be proud of the fact that we have got the idea of a European Police College under way. As you know, the idea came about in 1995 at a professional convention in Deggendorf in Lower Bavaria and was unanimously adopted in 1998 by this Parliament in the context of a report on internal security and eastward enlargement. At the time, we were concerned with the important matter, which we are finding ever more pressing, of not only having to get the applicant countries ready economically for accession but also of having to ensure, above all, that the framework conditions in terms of democracy, constitutionality and administration were right. On reading the latest progress reports, we note that there has been a considerable improvement in the way in which the legislation has been transposed. However, the way in which the legislation is applied in the applicant countries is still problematic because it is huge task, after decades of dictatorship, to construct new police forces, new systems of justice and new public prosecution authorities. In the report we produced at that time, we said that, in those countries which had found their way to democracy through their own efforts, we wanted, after decades of police States, to see the training of police who did not only genuinely accept the standards of European democracy but were also prepared to act in partnership. That is how the idea of a European Police College for the Member States of the European Union and for the applicant countries arose. This idea of Parliament’s was then adopted at the Tampere Summit, and I am very grateful to the Council for adopting this project, originated by Parliament, as its own. I am especially grateful to Commissioner Vitorino who has shown his vigorous commitment to a European Police College, something which also finds expression in the fact that the Portuguese government, which thinks along similar lines to himself, has thankfully seized this initiative. In accordance with the will of the Council and of that of this Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the European Police College is to become a reality as early as next year, more precisely as part of a network of national police training institutes with a joint remit, joint leadership and joint training programmes. However, we want this only to be a first step and we want an actual Police College to be set up within no more than two or three years. In this context, I should like to refer to a valuable comment by the French Presidency of the Council which said that we need a common, actually existing Police College of this kind in order to create a European culture of police training. Joint training of this kind is urgently needed when it comes to protecting external borders and combating cross-border crime and also when it comes to applying human rights standards in the European Union. It also has very wide support from police trade unions and professional associations. They know that, in the border area between the current EU and the applicant countries, such as in Eastern Bavaria, a great many towns have already asked for such a Police College. I am of the view, however, that it is still too early to make a decision on the matter. Naturally, that would be the best place for it to be located. It is now firstly a question, however, of actually creating this Police College, and all political forces are together helping to achieve this goal. I would thank the Bavarian and German ministers of the interior, as well as former Austrian Minister of the Interior Schlögel, who together made this possible back in Tampere. I believe this is a one-off opportunity to create a Europe in practical terms, namely a constitutional Europe that does not just exist in some documents or other but finds expression on an everyday basis. As the European Parliament, we can be proud that this is one of our own ideas and initiatives, which is to become a reality in just a few months' time.
costep_2009-02-02_13_37	Given the current climate in Europe, guaranteeing energy security is becoming a priority. Diversification of energy transit routes can be guaranteed by interconnecting Europe’s gas networks, which also supports solidarity between Member States, one of the European Union’s fundamental principles. In addition to the financial contributions made by Romania and Hungary themselves, the European Commission proposed last week the allocation of EUR 30 million for the completion of the Arad-Szeged gas pipeline project, the financing for which has been suspended for more than five years. This project is of paramount importance. The gas pipeline will not only link Romania and Hungary, but will also provide a connection to the European Union’s gas network. Once the pipeline is completed, Romania will be able to both export and import gas on the European market, not only in normal conditions but also in situations where there is a European energy crisis. With this in mind, I am calling on your support so that the Commission’s proposal is implemented as quickly as possible.
costep_2010-05-19_7_110	The transplantation of organs can deliver many years of full and healthy life for people who would otherwise frequently need intensive care, or would simply not survive. The number of transplants in the European Union has increased, saving and prolonging many lives. However, there are still long waiting lists for transplants. There are currently 56 000 patients waiting for a suitable organ donor in the European Union, and it is estimated that every day, 12 people die while waiting for a solid organ transplant. The number of deceased organ donors, on its own, is not enough and the number of live donors fails to satisfy requirements. Furthermore, there are wide variations between Member States in deceased organ donation rates and, at present, there is neither a database covering the whole of the European Union which contains information about organs intended for donation and transplantation or on living or deceased donors, nor a certification system which provides proof that human organs and tissues have been legally obtained. It is in this context that the report under discussion suggests steps that we consider important for strengthening cooperation between the Member States in this area, from which all of them could benefit.
costep_1997-04-08_2_16	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to compliment Mrs Roth on the careful, meticulous work that has gone into this report, most of which I too can agree with, although certain paragraphs are a little controversial, I have to say. Debate in the House has crystallized very much around what have been defined as the static and the dynamic concepts of human rights - and today is no exception. I have no answer to that: I do not know which of these two notions is correct. What goes without saying is that we all have to come to terms with rapid change. The concept of human rights is changing because the rights themselves are changing, in particular so-called social rights. We cannot, of course, agree with many of the report’s prescriptions - to coin a term - concerning social rights, and still less those concerning the right to social security: when the right to social security is taken to extremes and effective social and economic protection is demanded - including the right to a home, to good health, to a family, to beauty, to a wife, to make love, to do everything - well, that is obviously a way of devaluing the concept underlying this report. However, I do regard economic freedoms as fundamental, but for the opposite reasons to Mrs Roth: it is in fact because the welfare state is overloaded that cases of grinding poverty, exclusion and unemployment exist today. Of course Europe must set an example, and Mrs Roth is quite right about that: prison cannot be regarded as a place for punishment or, even worse, torture, but is for rehabilitation; trials must be just, so there must be genuine equality between the prosecution and defence; there must always be respect for the rule of law, even when combating terrorism or the Mafia; citizens should not be encouraged to become informers; asylum-seekers must also have a fair trial, including those fleeing from war or famine who are seeking hospitality from us - obviously this does not mean opening the floodgates to immigration. On all these points we shall naturally be voting in favour of the Roth report; the Italian delegation will vote in favour of the report despite its doubts concerning many paragraphs, such as paragraph 18 on active euthanasia, which we do not understand, paragraph 26 on depriving sects of freedom of religion, where it is unclear what constitutes a sect, and paragraph 142 on the right - amongst others - of adoption for homosexuals.
costep_2009-04-01_18_4	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the Community Code on Visas will mean that, in future, Schengen visas - visas for stays of up to three months - will be issued according to established uniform criteria in the Schengen area. This step is urgently needed in a European Union with open borders. At the same time, Member States' responsibility for processing visa applications is clarified. As a rule, applicants must contact the Member State in which their main destination is located. My group welcomes the fact that the requirement and the procedure for issuing entry visas will speed up entry for large numbers of people. This way, business travellers entering the EU will be treated fairly and, moreover, holidaymakers from all round the world - by far the largest group of travellers to the EU - will benefit. Thus we have not only made it possible to process visa applications quickly but also ensured that security screening prevents abuses. With its balance between security and facilitating entry, the Visa Information System affords Member States instant, direct access to all the relevant data in connection with the issuing of visas. Thus the examination of applications is being simplified while, at the same time, the issuing of visas will provide greater security in future thanks to the use of biometric identifiers; that is, photograph and fingerprints. The compromise struck between rapporteur Mr Lax and the Council takes account of Parliament’s original position and also has the support of the broad majority of my group. I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate my sincere thanks to Mr Lax for his commitment and his excellent cooperation over the last three years on this very complex dossier, which puts European visa policy on a new footing.
costep_2011-02-03_9_131	The Members of the European Parliament have voted in favour of a motion for a resolution in support of the 'Geneva Agreement', which is supposed to end the 'banana war'. In reality, this agreement directly threatens all European producers, but especially French overseas producers, when, moreover, various Latin American countries have already renegotiated in order to obtain further reductions, or even zero quotas. This scandal shows that, far from having settled this matter, they have opened up a new can of worms that will see us become a little more overwhelmed in trade terms not only in the area of bananas, but also with regard to other agricultural products. Viewed as they are as the cash cows of the world, Europe and France, bound hand and foot, are being left to the mercy of the full liberalisation of our markets with the criminal consent of political leaders obedient to the globalist and ultraliberal pro-Europeans. Instead of reducing import tariffs, we should establish a sensible policy of protectionism at our economic borders. This is one of the solutions, at the heart of the international trade war, that will protect French farmers and farming jobs, particularly in the overseas territories, where the economic and social situation is already disastrous enough.
costep_2009-09-16_15_15	I welcome the European Parliament’s initiative to begin a debate on the question of the Law for the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information, passed due to the efforts of the Lithuanian right wing parties. It is regrettable that the law was passed without its compliance with international and European Union law being sufficiently debated and assessed. The voice of non-governmental organisations also fell on deaf ears. Under the guise of the noble goal to protect children’s rights, in actual fact, a legal basis has been created to divide society, limit information and discriminate against individual groups of society. The former President of Lithuania vetoed the draft law, while the new President has set up a working group, which will submit a new draft of the law to Parliament in its session this autumn. I hope that there will be sufficient political will in Lithuania to improve the law, all the more so because we have experience adopting and implementing progressive laws in this area. Six years ago, the Law on equal opportunities was adopted thanks to the efforts of the Lithuanian social democrats and this prohibited any direct or indirect discrimination on the grounds of age, sexual orientation, disability, race or ethnic origin in all areas of life. At the moment, a similar draft directive is being debated in the Council of Ministers. This European Parliament resolution should encourage the Lithuanian Parliament to adopt such a law, which respects human rights and freedoms, and in which there is no place for any form of discrimination, including discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.
costep_2011-06-23_14_134	The Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Seychelles serves the interests of both parties. Above all, EU vessels are able to access Seychelles' waters and engage in fishing. These vessels are creating many new jobs for Seychelles seamen. The agreement is strengthening cooperation and promoting a partnership framework, and scientific cooperation in the areas of responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries. Furthermore, the Seychelles fishing sector enjoys favourable development conditions, by engaging in responsible fishing, combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing effectively, and fully using its vessel monitoring system. It should be noted that the provisions of the renewed agreement will have a positive impact on the European canned tuna market and will undoubtedly help stabilise it. It will promote compliance with conservation measures on the high seas and will create the conditions to stop vessels fishing illegally. I welcome the fact that it was possible to reach a compromise between both parties and that the protocol on the renewal of the agreement includes a suspension clause on breaches of human rights and non-compliance with ILO principles. Attention should be drawn to the fact that piracy still poses a significant threat to the security of vessels in the Indian Ocean. Consequently, both parties must take the necessary measures and action to stop this magnitude of illegal activity.
costep_2001-11-12_10_7	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work. This document gives a clear picture of the difficulties European cinema has been striving painfully to overcome for many years now. I would like to focus briefly on two of the many points contained in the motion for a resolution which caught my attention. Firstly, I fully support the call for the funds made available to the film-making industry to be increased. In effect, considering that the cinema has become an important part of our cultural heritage - cinemas have been more popular than bookshops for many years now in Europe - and given the high potential for employment in this sector, there is no doubt that greater Community financial aid would facilitate its development. And this is precisely one of the problematic areas. Without incentives and investment, there is no growth or impetus, and there is no quality either. Europe has been overrun with film productions which are foreign to our cultural identity and often of dubious quality for too long now. That is not to question the existence of the opportunity or rather the need for cinema to encourage awareness of diversities, of course, but I do feel that Europe needs to protect and encourage its own film heritage. If, in addition, we consider the competition which came from television during the 1970s, it is not hard to see why hundreds, thousands of cinemas have been closed for so long. Secondly, I fully support item 18, which refers explicitly to the restoration and protection of the European film heritage. We do indeed need to encourage public institutions, local authorities and cultural associations to search for old and short films and to restore film material, thus ensuring that they are preserved and are available to the public. There are very few film libraries in Europe which are worthy of that name and genuinely properly equipped and efficient. They often suffer from miserly public contributions from the governments of the Member States. Well then, the European Union cannot remain insensitive to this additional urgent need if we genuinely want to preserve the past heritage and guarantee the future of cinema.
costep_2011-06-07_9_59	Drugs are one of the major scourges of our society today. This is a socially and culturally complex and dynamic problem, which is constantly changing and taking on new forms, with the use of new substances and new groups of consumers. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) was set up in 1993, and its main tasks are to collect data on drugs and drug addiction, and to prepare and publish objective, reliable and comparable information at European level. This information is vital as it provides a basis for the analysis of demand for drugs and of ways of reducing it, as well as of phenomena associated with the drug market in general. Croatia is a transit route through which illegal drugs are smuggled on the way from production countries to consumer countries. It is therefore crucial for Europe that Croatia provide information concerning drugs and drug addiction, and their consequences. It is also crucial that it be able to obtain information on best practices. That is why I am voting for this recommendation.
costep_1999-07-21_6_25	Mr President, between the devil of Milosevic and the deep blue sea of NATO: this is the feeling of most of the Serbian democratic opposition to Milosevic. Between the violence of Serbian paramilitary forces, the intimidation and violence of the KLA and NATO bombs falling from the sky: this is the sentiment of those Kosovo Albanian troops who chose to fight for their rights without resorting to violence. Against the NATO bombings and against nationalism and the homicidal and suicidal politics of Milosevic: this is the feeling of millions and millions of European men and women who hold the respect of human rights to be fundamental, wherever they have been violated: in Kosovo, Kurdistan, Palestine or Iran. These are the democratic, peaceful forces which should have been supported by the international community. Obviously, Milosevic had and has to be stopped, as the KLA had and has to be stopped, each responsible in different ways. Now, after NATO has destroyed and laid waste in the name of the defence of human rights, we must rebuild. We hope and wish to act in this Parliament so that construction takes place in such a way that human resources and the dignity of each side involved in the conflict are respected and valued during the process, and that colonisation by Europe or the United States World Bank is avoided. Kosovo must be reconstructed with its present and past inhabitants - both Albanian and Serbian - as protagonists. At the same time, Serbia and Montenegro and the infrastructures laid to waste and destroyed by air raids, must be rebuilt, and the damage to the environment investigated and remedied. The reconstruction of Kosovo must focus not only on the economy and trade, but also on the social, civil and democratic fabric. To achieve this, reconstruction must be carried out through the involvement of local communities, with exchanges between municipalities, universities, men and women of the European Union, Kosovo and the Republic of Yugoslavia. For the war to be truly erased from the picture, we must bring about reconciliation, create societies and build democracy. This is our challenge.
costep_2007-03-14_6_25	Paragraph 6 of this report on social services of general interest points out 'the Member State authorities' freedom to define, organise and finance social services of general interest as they see fit', in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. This one sentence, notwithstanding the so-called 'joint responsibility' of the Union, renders the rest of the text meaningless: public services fall within and must continue to fall within the Member States' prerogative, and theirs alone. It is up to each Member State to decide whether these services depend on the market, or on national solidarity as the guarantor of the common good, or indeed on a fair balance between these two elements. In other words, it is not the responsibility of either the Commission or the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to define, and even less to rule over, public services. We know only too well what happens if they do act in that way: the privatisation of profits, in the name of ultra-liberalism and of competition, and this, to the great advantage of international capital; and the 'nationalisation' of losses, without any concern for the general interest or for that of the citizens, especially the poorest among them. It can never be said enough how responsible these policies are for the social disintegration that our countries are now experiencing.
costep_2001-05-17_9_10	Mr President, press freedom is one of the keystones that underpins real democracy. This freedom is lacking in many dictatorships due to the fear on the part of those in power of informed citizens, debate, opposition and disclosure. Europe needs to take a stand in favour of press freedom and those who fight for this, in a consistent manner. Understandably, our attention turns to the developing countries and the former centrally governed countries which are now in transition. This is with good reason, for we can often lend these countries real support with our aid and resources to local NGOs, civil society and the different media involved. As Social-Democrats we consider this topic of press freedom to be a cornerstone of our belief. However, within Europe, we would draw your attention to a particularly disquieting phenomenon, namely the concentration of ownership and control of media in Europe in a limited number of countries. That affects diversity in a fundamental way. This becomes even more serious if economic power and political power are combined. That is when freedom is at risk. I do not need to name any names to make myself clear. The European Parliament’s socialist group will take the initiative for proposals which resist this threat of press freedom. Unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats has announced that, despite the fact that it has taken the initiative for this resolution, it refuses to back this resolution. In fact, it has threatened to vote against this resolution if this section were to be adopted. Does the power, or the fear, of the aforementioned person extend so far that he already has the People’s Party in his clutches? We would ask the People’s Party to consider urgently whether it would like to defend press freedom or the concentration of power. It will make for an interesting outcome of the vote.
costep_2003-07-02_3_130	We are all convinced that fighting for multilateralism is a good thing. With multilateralism under threat, we must do all we can to make Cancun a success. But it is a bit like squaring the circle. On the one hand the Americans are defending their interests by every means, while cultivating the myth of total free trade and, on the other, many countries of the South are unable to take their place in the world economy, questioning the present trade rules and demanding positive discrimination. How can the EU play its part as a bridge-builder and point the US in the right direction? While noting the positive efforts that have been made, I do wonder about a number of points in the policy on Cancun because we, too, are not without contradictions between our interests and our intentions. Firstly, how can we make a better defence of special and differential treatment? The developing countries are not the only ones at fault; we are not clear on this point either. The scope for such treatment is excessively broad, depriving the concept of differentiation of any real relevance. And the question of the rules is very much a grey area. Can we look at them again for TRIPS and for regional areas, not forgetting the question of technology transfer? Secondly, I support those who do not want to drop the aim of preparing questions about 'Singapore' - I differ from Mrs McNally slightly here - because it involves key aspects of the link between trade and development. But does the EU have to stick to its initial line? I agree with the bottom up approach, but would it not be better to support the restrictions, especially pre-establishment, involved in the claim for a political area? Moreover, there is an urgent need for the Cancun talks to be underpinned by powerful parallel initiatives for the redistribution of direct investments, guaranteeing their sustainability. Thirdly, so far as agriculture is concerned, we are defending a strong position regarding internal support and the calculation of tariff reductions. But will the most vulnerable countries of the South, which only produce one thing and are net importers, benefit in any way from it? Should we not increase market access and abolish export subsidies on products that are strategic for those countries and adopt a framework initiative in favour of fair trade?
costep_2007-12-12_12_6	Mr President, growing extremism in Europe is a fact, and we need to talk about it. The Commissioner said a great deal, but he spoke in general terms and about matters of secondary importance such as racism at football matches. We need to talk about the facts, the political extremism we are witnessing at the present time in the European Union. Yesterday, Mr President, the leader of the NPD, a neo-fascist party, appeared on Germany’s public television channel, ARD, and demanded that Poland immediately return Pomerania and Silesia to Germany. He declared that Kaliningrad, Gdańsk and Wrocław are German cities and demanded German jurisdiction over them. He also demanded that those cities and territories, which are part of Poland, should be returned to Germany immediately. We are talking about events in Germany, a leading country in the European Union. For some years now, the German fascists in the NPD have been calling for the revision of frontiers, repudiating the international treaties that ended the Second World War, and demanding that borders be pushed back. Commissioner, we cannot permit this. There has to be a strong reaction. We cannot permit the public television service of any country, in this case Germany, to allow neo-fascists and Nazis to air their revisionist views and calls for another war. This is not a marginal problem, ladies and gentlemen. It is very real. The party in question has representatives in seven regional parliaments. This cannot be tolerated in Europe today, just as we cannot tolerate democratic principles, freedom to differ and freedom of speech to be undermined as they were today by Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Watson, who, referring to differences of opinion over the Charter of Fundamental Rights - or rather, not so much the Charter as the EU Reform Treaty - called the Members who were opposing him idiots. That cannot be allowed. That is not the approach to democracy and the present European Union that we should be teaching our young people. Let us be united in diversity.
costep_2009-03-12_10_68	I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on water in the light of the Fifth World Water Forum as I believe that we urgently need to devise global policies on water supply and management in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). These provide for the halving by 2015 of the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water. However, the global financial crisis means that the Member States need to step up their support for the least developed countries, through public development aid and cooperation in adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change.
costep_2010-02-10_10_139	I voted for this resolution because the European Union must combat illegal immigration and human trafficking. With growing unemployment, there will be an increase in the number of people who may become victims of human trafficking or may be exploited for forced labour. Above all, people who have lost their jobs in their own country, who have lost hope for a better life, will seek success elsewhere. Such a situation can be exploited by criminal gangs. The main area of trafficking involving children, in particular, girls and women, has not changed for many years. Sexual exploitation in conditions akin to slavery is particularly prevalent in Eastern Europe, which is like a transit route for trafficking human beings to the west. We must prepare a strategy of measures to combat trafficking in human beings, in which most attention is devoted to fighting human trafficking, to prevention and to the protection of victims and penalties. All Member States must take severe measures to fight against human trafficking, ensuring the coordination of national legislation. We must strive for closer cooperation among all the interested parties on the question of human trafficking.
costep_1998-03-31_4_15	Mr President, there is a fundamental debate, certainly, but here we are simply involved in a procedural debate, and we have to raise the question as to whether the draft which is submitted conforms with what was voted on within the Committee on Budgetary Control. While open to correction, I think there is little doubt, firstly that the text on which we have voted and which is authoritative is the German text; secondly, this German text included the expression independent authority in German and it did not contain the expression European public prosecutor, which for its part comes from another source, namely the corpus juris proposed by the Commission. Therefore, I think that in procedural terms, there is no ambiguity. We have indeed voted on a draft which spoke of an independent judicial authority. In the event of disagreement with this draft, it would, it appears to me, have been necessary to table an amendment according to the prescribed procedure, and this being the case, there would have indeed been a translation error between the German text and the other linguistic versions. I therefore think that we should stay with the vote on the basis of the German text, which is the faithful version.
costep_2003-05-12_1_22	Mr President, last week, the former governor of the Colombian province of Antioquia, Mr Gaviria, and his peace adviser, Mr Echeverri, with both of whom a delegation from this Parliament had met, were, together with eight other people belonging to the army and the state security services, shamefully assassinated by the guerrilla forces of the Colombian FARC who had been holding them prisoner under cruel conditions. These events, which have caused an upheaval in the country, again make clear the true criminal character of this organisation - which is still holding the presidential candidate, Íngrid Betancourt, captive - and make it abundantly clear how wise it was to decide to include it on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations. I would, for all these reasons, ask you, on behalf of this Assembly, to convey to Colombia’s legitimate authorities our solidarity with the victims' families and our active commitment to the cause of peace in that country.
costep_2010-03-09_10_40	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, my political group. On 5 March, the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, signed an interpretative decree-law, also known as the 'save list' decree-law. In fact, this decree allows the rules of the game to be changed after the electoral campaign has started. On the website of the Quirinal Palace, Giorgio Napolitano himself states that, unlike the draft decree proposed to him by the government in a tense meeting on Thursday evening, in his view, the text subsequently drafted by the Ministry of the Interior and the Prime Minister did not present obvious defects of an unconstitutional nature. Article 87(5) of the Italian Constitution lays down that the President of the Italian Republic shall promulgate laws and issue decrees with the force of law, and regulations. The President of the Republic absolutely cannot participate in the drafting of procedures and of decree-laws. The President of the Republic’s predecessor, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, considers it to be an aberrant distortion of our democratic system. It is clear that the government is doing what the constitution prohibits. That decree, Mr President, has changed the rules of the game for an electoral competition that has already begun and allows those who have broken the law to stand, having been readmitted to the electoral competition. I wonder why Parliament is always ready to take a stand against countries that violate laws but does not acknowledge that there is a country among the 27 Member States that is violating laws. The President cut off the speaker
costep_2000-03-29_7_20	Mr President, I believe that this debate is appropriate at the end of the five-year period for which MEDA was programmed, but I also believe that we are going to have time to discuss this new regulation, which at the moment is being debated in this House. What I mean to say is that, in any event, I share the Commission’s concern and I think the proposal to simplify the procedures is a positive one. I hope that this Parliament will support it. In the few seconds allocated to me, I will simply refer to two aspects which I believe should be dealt with urgently in relation to the MEDA programmes. Firstly, decentralised cooperation and the activities generated by the Barcelona Process between the most active social operators from the non-Community Mediterranean countries and the European Union. These are projects, which, as well as having intrinsic value, create growth in the social sectors in these countries. It seems essential to me, since we want an area of free trade and prosperity, and since we also want to push decisively for democratisation in this area in the southern Mediterranean, that we support the men and women who are trying to work in this field. We must put an end to the poor esteem in which they currently hold the Union and we must once again ensure that their expectations and ambitions are supported by the Union. I believe furthermore that the Commission must have sufficient human and material resources to do so. The second issue which concerns me is the inclusion of immigration in the regulation. I am concerned about how this issue will be dealt with in the Mediterranean area. We must not only create agreements on the readmission clauses, and not only provide resources for guarding borders. We must also, by means of imagination and new measures, create the capacity for co-partnership with these countries, so that we can adopt a legal approach to the issue of immigration and so that people do not simply feel that we have closed the border to them but that they can move freely within this free trade area.
costep_1997-07-18_5_8	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the position taken by the rapporteur, Mrs Leperre-verrier, and by other colleagues, in particular Mrs Doris Pack, who led this whole process, to make the European Parliament’s agreement depend on a reinforcement of the SOCRATES budget is fully justified. We have to take into account the ultimate impact on the success of enlargement of a poor start to cooperation in the fields of training and education, essential for paving the way for other areas of enlargement, that all proEuropeans want to see succeed. Unless SOCRATES is given at least 100 million ECU more, the extension to the countries of central and eastern Europe will have negative rather than positive consequences. I said the day before yesterday in this Chamber that the Council cannot give us this programme with one hand and take way resources with another. I shall not go on and shall instead take this opportunity to stress that, among the SOCRATES objectives, there are language-learning actions, vital in order to create understanding between the fifteen and the candidates for accession. Language-learning, and in general a genuine European policy on languages, demands urgent attenuation by the institutions. A question of this importance, for the preservation of identities and for normalizing transnational communication and the efficiency of the European institutions, cannot be left to the will of certain Member States that might just be tempted to transform their interests into acquired rights given the void in terms of Community policy. On the other hand, it is vital to achieve coordination between the various bodies where there is a discussion of the European language policy, both inside and outside the institutions. I hope that the Culture Committee will take its place in the inter-institutional working group on languages, chaired by one of our Vice-Presidents. I also hope that the conference on a 'Constellation of languages in Europe', to be held shortly in Luxembourg, will receive a committed contribution by all Community DGs linked to this issue. In that way, Mr President, we should in the near future establish a European language policy based on a broad consensus and solid academic, political and functional criteria.
costep_2011-05-11_4_43	Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon, with its excessively complicated changes, renders setting up institutions and defining duties difficult. Even the existing institutions are unable to perform their proper functions due to the many changes. Thus, chaos rules everywhere, and everyone is confused. The question arises: what sense is there in creating and vesting with power the European External Action Service, which still has not commenced operations? Defence and security is an area everywhere in the world which requires rapid reaction and action. While the composition, locations and positions are being debated, the European Union is passing up the opportunity of being able to function meaningfully in this area. Once it has been established, it should work and be effective. For precisely this reason, we must do all we can in order to launch the service as soon as possible. Regrettably, in the area of external relations, the country currently holding the Presidency cannot shape a programme for foreign affairs, common defence or security, and thus, my fellow Members, you have no other choice than to support Mrs Ashton’s work, which is starting with great difficulty.
costep_2009-02-03_7_71	Pre-commercial procurement occurs when the public sector places orders in the area of research and development, thus supporting innovation and ensuring the sustainability and high quality of public services. Pre-commercial procurement is tremendously important in terms of strengthening the innovation potential of the entire European Union, improving public services provided directly to the citizens, and also eliminating the gap between supply and demand in the public sector. One example of a solution developed on the basis of public procurement is the GPS navigation system. In the United States, the funding allocated to orders in the area of research and development is 20 times greater than that allocated in the European Union. For SMEs, public procurement represents a valuable opportunity to gain experience. Pre-commercial procurement contracts are advantageous for smaller enterprises, as the latter often do not comply with the requirements for ordinary commercial public procurement. As a matter of urgency, Europe should develop comprehensive solutions to improve the use of pre-commercial procurement, not only by national authorities, but also by local and regional ones.
costep_2009-12-14_18_19	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, against a backdrop of serious economic crisis, characterised by very severe effects on employment, with many workers standing to lose their jobs and, at the same time, countless young people not able to enter the labour market for the first time, it is essential that the European Union and the Member States take action, both with global strategies and with targeted instruments. The microfinance facility is precisely an instrument targeted at people, the aim of which is to provide a response to all those individuals who, excluded from the bank credit market and having difficulty entering the labour market, intend to start a project, an economic activity, which, nonetheless, can generate individual income and thus contribute to overall growth. In particular, if we want the micro-credit instrument to be effective and to yield lasting results, the Member States must prepare themselves sufficiently, including by establishing links at local administrative level, which is in more direct contact with situations of social crisis, and by taking an active role in making this new facility easily accessible. It is important to stress that the long-term effectiveness of activities financed by micro-credit instruments and the possibility of fully achieving social integration largely depend on simultaneous guidance, mentoring and training programmes, which must accompany microfinance. At the same time, given the objectives to be achieved with the micro-credit instrument, it is necessary to emphasise one crucial action, namely actively promoting equal opportunities for men and women in access to microfinance programmes. In fact, it is women who are particularly discriminated against and disadvantaged, in terms of access to both the labour market and the conventional credit market. Generally speaking, it is reassuring to note that the European Parliament is united and agrees on the issue of micro-credit and against such a socio-economic backdrop as this. It is up to the Council and the Member States to show that they are serious and committed, and pave the way so that the financial situation can be set right.
costep_1999-03-09_12_38	I merely wish to make a remark concerning the limits of territorial waters. There is no reference to territorial waters surrounding the Rock in the Treaty of Utrecht, which justifies and legitimises certain British activities in Gibraltar. You will be aware, Commissioner, that according to the Treaty of Utrecht, the town and fortress of Gibraltar were ceded to the United Kingdom. However, that Treaty does not cover the area later occupied by the British and which does not have territorial waters. The extent of Spanish and British territorial waters has never been specified, because although Spain recognises the Treaty of Utrecht, it disputes the United Kingdom’s claims in this respect. Furthermore, Spain’s claims were not affected in any way by its accession to the Community. On 12 June 1985, Spain signed the Accession Treaty along with the United Kingdom. On 15 June, letters were exchanged with the British Minister for Foreign Affairs, making it quite clear that Spain’s accession to the Community did not affect its claim to Gibraltar.
costep_1998-10-08_6_53	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr von Habsburg has already said that we have a fundamental problem here. As we have seen, the signing of partnership, cooperation and interim agreements does not automatically improve the human rights situation in the partner countries in the manner provided for by European Commission of Human Rights. Although the Commission always claims that these agreements are necessary in order to help improve the human rights situation, this is not the case. Nothing is being done. The interim agreement with Georgia was signed a long time ago and nothing has happened. I believe that, particularly when a democratic society is being constructed, a democratic judiciary and humane conditions in prisons are a highly sensitive area. Ukraine and Russia have an action plan in this field through TACIS. Georgia does not. This is why it is important that Georgia also has an action programme for democracy, in cooperation with the Council of Europe, through the TACIS programme. I am pleased that Mr von Habsburg supports our amendments provided that the first amendment takes the form of an addition. We would then make an oral amendment to the second amendment.
costep_2000-03-14_4_6	Mr President, Commissioner, since we cannot reject the directive on chocolate which is, as it stands, unacceptable, Parliament is duty bound, at the very least, to improve it. In the first place, we must ask ourselves what is the relevance of this directive which is going to change the definition of chocolate. The European Parliament must be aware that the Codex Alimentarius, which dictates the composition of chocolate internationally, stipulates that it is made from cocoa butter. What right, then, has the European Union, with regard to the food traditions of some Member States who incorrectly describe products including vegetable fats other than cocoa butter as 'chocolate', to enforce a change in the very definition of what chocolate is? In authorising the addition of 5% of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter today, the European Parliament is opening the way to many other impostures. What is there to stop us, in future, describing oil to which palm oil has been added as olive oil? In the second place, if the text of the common position goes unchanged, then consumers will be needing a magnifying glass in order to examine the composition of chocolate products. This is really why I am urging my fellow Members to vote in favour of the amendments which will enable consumers, at the very first glance, to distinguish real chocolate from chocolate made with vegetable fats other than cocoa butter. Finally, as producing countries, already aware that cocoa prices are today at rock bottom, we are in danger of making them collapse completely, if we adopt this position. In order to avoid chaos in producing countries, the European Parliament must demand an impact study on the export situation. I therefore call upon you to support all the amendments presented by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.
costep_2000-10-24_9_5	Mr President, for the European Union this is simply one more debate of the many that we hold. For the outermost regions this is the most important debate that the European Parliament can hold concerning them. In fact, what we say here today and how we vote tomorrow will be front-page news in the seven outermost regions, and the news reports on the regional television channels will report extensively on what we say and decide here. For many Europeans, some outermost regions are nothing more than a holiday destination on the map. This may even be the view of some of our fellow MEPs of the outermost regions. For those of us who are speaking here tonight on behalf of our native regions, this is a very negative view, and, of course, a deeply mistaken one. Behind this idea, beyond our landscape and an exceptional climate, is the social and economic reality of regions that are among the least developed in the European Union, with the highest levels of unemployment and with huge structural problems that impede our development. For more than a decade the European Commission has been aware of our problems and our particular characteristics. This is the first debate that the plenary session of the European Parliament has held about our regions since the Treaty of Amsterdam included a new article on them. So far, since an interdepartmental group was set up for the outermost regions under the presidency of Mr Delors, we have travelled a long and fruitful road, and I must express the deepest gratitude of the Europeans from the outermost regions to those who have presided over that group. The Commission document for implementing paragraph 2 of Article 299 of the EC Treaty is a good document, and our rapporteur, Mrs Sudre, has done well today by offering us an excellent report. With this Article and with the measures taken in order to implement it, we have a legal basis that until now we were lacking, and a good tool for our development. Mrs Sudre has succeeded in putting together a balanced report that includes many of the amendments - more than 100 of them - which were tabled for the initial draft report. One of these amendments proposes the implementation and application of the policies of the financial instrument for fisheries. What I wish to highlight here today, Commissioner Barnier, is that, for the outermost regions, while Community law fully applies, it is essential that those rules be modulated and adapted in order to stimulate rather than impede their economic and social cohesion with the rest of the European citizens. The internal market and the rules that govern it do not benefit the outermost regions to the same extent that they benefit Europeans on the continent. The natural limitations of our island markets, thousands of kilometres away, mean that our businesses have difficulty being competitive: problems with transport, communications, supplies, running costs. This is why we have so many problems generating wealth and creating employment. Our unemployment levels are among the highest in the European Union. It is therefore necessary to implement a series of measures which Margie Sudre’s report covers in detail. In our view these measures need to go beyond regional development policies, because our shortfalls and handicaps are structural, not temporary. We will always be far away and we will always have difficulties because of the fact that we are islands and because of our landscape, which is beautiful but also harsh and difficult to overcome. We are not asking for subsidies. We want to have tools that will enable us to develop. The outermost regions bring Atlantic, American and African dimensions to Europe, which enrich our cultural, political and economic diversity, of which we are all rightly proud.
costep_2009-09-15_4_6	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you Mr Barrot and Mr Billström. Back on 31 August, I tabled a priority question to the Commission. It is true that the number of migrants reaching Italian and Libyan shores has fallen, but this is because the number of dead which the Mediterranean Sea continues to receive has risen. Alas, the Mediterranean has now become a mass grave and the Berlusconi Government, to wit, the Italian Government, has signed an agreement with Libya which unfortunately allows Italy to refuse entry not only to migrants, but also refugees from countries where there is persecution or civil war, such as Somalia and Eritrea, and denies these poor people the right to seek asylum, thereby breaching every international rule and the Geneva Convention in particular. I would remind you that non-refoulement is a principle which knows no geographical boundaries and which cannot be haggled over or negotiated under any circumstances. We do not want to continue thinking that ultimately, this Italy-Libya agreement boils down to economic interests worth around EUR 5 000 billion. I demand that the Commission does not - if this is its intention - conclude an EU-Libya agreement similar to the Italian one, as we have seen the results of that despicable agreement. I repeat, alas this agreement forces these people to undergo torture, because this is what we are dealing with: the detention centres to which they are taken in Libya are torture, according to press reports and also photographs, for example, photographs which show many of these immigrants in Ganfuda prison, 10 kilometres from Benghazi. This is torture, which I do not believe is accounted for in any friendship or institutional agreements. As highlighted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the non-refoulement principle prevents people being returned to territories where their lives could be considered to be in danger or their freedom could be threatened. Sending these people back to Libya which, I would again remind you, has neither signed nor ratified the Geneva Convention, seems truly unbelievable. Moreover, to add insult to injury, illegal immigration is a criminal offence in Italy so, for example, after the dramatic landing at the end of August in which many Somalis lost their lives, those few, I think four or five Somalis who managed to reach their destination have, among other things, been accused of immigration and are therefore now being prosecuted under Italian law. I call on the Commission now to take real action, to assess whether the Italy-Libya agreement complies with international law and finally bring about a decisive change of course by not supporting the Italian Government’s nefarious policy.
costep_2009-04-02_10_154	There is definitely only one nation that never finds favour in the eyes of this Parliament, which is usually so quick to approve any economic, commercial or cooperation agreement with Cuba, the Chinese communist dictatorship or even the Turkey of Prime Minister Erdogan. The majority in this Parliament, who gave an enthusiastic welcome to Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence, despite its being the historic cradle of the Serbian nation, is now harvesting the bitter fruits of its policy, with the Russian-backed independence of Abkhazia and Ossetia. Furthermore, how can only Russia be blamed for the misunderstanding over security issues, when the expansion of NATO up to her borders is naturally seen by the Russians as a provocation and a threat? Of course, difficulties remain. Russia though, unlike Turkey, belongs culturally, spiritually and geographically to Europe. It is first and foremost with her that we should have privileged links.
costep_2009-01-13_9_99	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report presented by Mrs Breyer on the placing of plant protection products on the market. I agree with the purposes and goals, which are to ensure a high level of protection for human health and the environment. The European Union has always placed particular emphasis on topics relating to the environment and this regulation is another strategy designed to achieve this aim. I am also convinced that it is right to provide for experiments on animals to be kept to a minimum and carried out only in the event of absolute need and for the use of alternative methods to be promoted so that animals are spared needless suffering.
costep_2011-03-09_14_12	Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, two years ago, in other words, before the demonstrations in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, the people of Tehran took to the streets. They did so at the risk of their own lives. They took to the streets because they wanted greater democracy. They also wanted to protest against the intolerance and repression of a flawed regime. I am therefore pleased that the emphasis in this report is on human rights and I congratulate Mr Belder for that. The lesson that we need to learn is that we have to do everything in our power to assist the opposition and all those who have demonstrated. We need to extend a helping hand to them against the regime. Why do we have to do so? We have to do so because the regime has the money and the oil and those who are being oppressed will only be able to achieve anything if we also make an effort. I think it is a very good thing that we are very clear about this point in paragraph 32 of your report, Mr Belder. Mr President, when I see the repression, I would also like to hear from you what we are doing when it comes to the opposition leader, Mr Mousavi. Are we still paying attention to the fate of Mr Karoubi? What specific options do we, as the European Union, have in order to provide more support? Proof of the dynamism of Iranian society can also be seen in the one million signatures campaign, a campaign led by women who have been collecting one million signatures for the cause of opposing discriminatory legislation. I want to pay sincere tribute to these brave women. I would like Baroness Ashton to tell me where she can offer consular assistance, as this is not always offered.
costep_2002-09-24_2_252	Mr President, in all of the European Union’s Equal Opportunities Action Programmes, for example the Fifth Action Programme for 2001 to 2005, great importance is attached to there being balanced representation of men and women in decision-making bodies. While good statistics are available in parliaments and national institutions, there are still not any satisfactory surveys of the social partners. In both the unions and the employers' organisations women in leadership roles are in a tiny minority. There is no doubt that this needs to be changed, but please not at a snail’s pace. In the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, we have unanimously called on the social partners to set precise targets as soon as possible with a view to improving the quantitative and qualitative representation of women. As part of this, deadlines should be agreed for their implementation. Databases should be created so as finally to provide a precise overview of female representation in expert fora and decision-making bodies. A further long overdue measure is the creation of posts for equal opportunities officers in all of the Member States. Whenever change is initiated, however, intensive awareness-raising is required. In training courses and at conferences on gender mainstreaming, women’s structures in the social partners should be visible. Positive measures need to be developed in the form of action programmes within organisations. Women’s networks should be created and should communicate with each other. They should exchange experiences and pass on information about projects to each other. These projects were successful and are therefore worth replicating and the others failed and we should try to understand what we can learn from them. An important component is responsibility at executive level right up to the boardroom. There are therefore sufficient reasons for drawing up this own-initiative report. The vote in the Women’s Rights Committee was unanimous and is testimony to the exemplary work of our rapporteur, Miet Smet. I too can fully endorse this assessment of her report.
costep_2003-05-12_1_9	Mr President, as you have just announced, the Conference of Presidents has not complied with the request that we made of it. I would like to use this opportunity to again briefly explain to the plenary why it is, in our opinion, that we should not have a debate without Parliament’s opinion being expressed. Now that the hostilities are over, it is clear how things stand in Iraq, and this makes it possible for this House not only to have a debate on the situation there, but also to frame a resolution stating the position this House takes in the light of what is actually happening in Iraq. The Conference of Presidents gave me the impression that there is some degree of fear, particularly among the members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that Parliament could again end up in the position it was in last time and be unable to adopt a resolution. I do not want to enlarge on the reasons for this, as I would then have to address a certain person to my right, but perhaps, given a little goodwill on the part of all the groups involved, we now have the chance to put together a resolution that would indeed express not only the consensus in this House, but also the stance of the European Union, or could define Parliament’s demand that the European Union’s position be expressed through a Common Foreign and Security Policy, which is again possible and necessary. Our group therefore asks that the debate be accompanied by the text of a resolution.
costep_2001-07-03_8_5	Mr President, they asked me, the representative elected from the lists of the Pensioners' Party in Italy: What are you going to Strasbourg for? They will never talk about pensions! Well, the words of Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou just now have been as sweet as honey to my ears. I welcome this initiative: it is a great day for pensioners all over Europe! My congratulations to Mrs Diamantopoulou and the whole of the Commission! The most important thing will now be to monitor the pension funds and appoint as their guardians in the 15 States, not the Beagle Boys but people who care about the future of pensioners. I hope that the Commissioner will agree with me.
costep_2008-06-05_3_10	I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, for his report, dealing with two different themes that are subject to different procedures. Since the hygiene of foodstuffs is subject to the codecision procedure, this procedure will inevitably hold back the area of prices and transport conditions, subject only to a consultation process. I agree with the stipulation that food safety requirements in individual Member States must be the same across the board, or at least should not significantly differ from each other. However, here we come to the question of imports to the European Union from third countries where the foodstuffs are full of pesticides. We have a polluted environment, which has a negative impact on human health. Consequently, we must do everything possible to prevent unhealthy foodstuffs from damaging our health. We have to start testing foodstuffs, their components and the raw materials of animal and plant origin for health hazards, hygienic acceptability and biological values. We have to concentrate on identification or on possible falsification. We have to test for foreign materials in food and to focus on everyday use: for example not just phthalates in toys, which are not used by everyone on a daily basis. Slovak producers are often criticised with regard to the hygiene of foodstuffs. I must point out, however, that Slovakia has much stricter food standards than the 15 old Member States.
costep_2010-03-10_8_1	Mr President, I would like to announce that I support this decision, although my card was not working to begin with and that is why I want to announce this. Now to the matter in hand. Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on a change to the annual accounting responsibilities of micro-entities. This project caused stormy debate at almost all levels, both in European Union and Member State institutions. I am convinced that we must prepare common European Union rules. However, I would like to underline that by reducing the administrative burden on micro-entities, we must not infringe conditions for fair competition in either the internal markets of Member States or the European Union market. I think that a single tax should be created for micro-entities, which already exists in some states. If it could be calculated, it could be calculated either on the basis of the number of employees or turnover or territory, depending on the type of business. As a result, those companies would no longer be tempted to engage in illegal activities.
costep_1997-11-18_4_21	Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Party of the European Radical Alliance, I would like to express my simultaneous satisfaction and disappointment at the situation and the way the BSE question has been handled: first my satisfaction, as an MEP, at the very important role played by Parliament in dealing with this issue and stimulating the Commission; and my satisfaction at seeing how the Commission has in many ways responded to the legitimate expectations of this Parliament, which is also an expression of European public opinion, by curbing the risks of the mad cow affair, carrying out inspections and not repeating the mistakes of the past. But I am also disappointed to see that not all our recommendations have been followed by the Commission, which has perhaps been too timid, President Santer, with regard to the accompanying measures, the reorganization has been good, the work carried out so far has been very good, particularly that of the Commissioner responsible for this sector and by the Commission as a whole, but in my opinion it is a pity not to have had the courage to go right to the end, as Parliament requested, both internally and with regard to measures against the state which, I have to say, was at the origin of this crisis. I am also disappointed with those MEPs who relied on slaughter and called for a mass cull, thereby giving us and the Commission an inappropriate image. It is just as well that those threats were not followed up and that the proposed censure motion did not materialize; Parliament will vote seriously on a critical wording but naturally cannot fail to recognize that a lot of good work has already been done.
costep_2002-04-24_3_66	Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation I would firstly like to thank the Commission for their communication on the promotion of human rights and also congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Díez González, on her excellent report, which complements and strengthens the already positive proposals put forward by the Commission in their communication. The European Union’s commitment to the defence of human rights and democratic principles needs effective, and above all coherent, action; if there is no coherence, there is no credibility, and without credibility there is no authority to promote and demand respect for human rights. For this reason I support the strategic and comprehensive approach proposed by the Commission with regard to integrating human rights into EU foreign policy and ensuring that all policies, all Community programmes and projects, take this issue into account. Finally, I support the approach geared towards humanitarian aid based on human rights, because of the importance it can have in terms of conflict prevention, and I believe that Country Strategy Papers should propose specific measures for the promotion of human rights, which should be treated as a priority. The struggle for human rights cannot be disassociated from the fight against poverty and development cooperation policy, inasmuch as both promote the establishment of the economic and social conditions necessary to guarantee peace and to ensure that everyone can live in dignity; conditions without which the respect for fundamental rights is no more than a pipe dream. For this reason I would make a particular request to the Commission that, in the context of political dialogue and the discussion of the Country Strategy Papers, universal access to education should be considered as a priority issue, because education is indispensable for the development of populations, and without development it will be very difficult for us to talk about full respect for human rights.
costep_2008-04-10_12_48	By voting for Paul Rübig’s report, the European Parliament is sending a clear signal to small and medium-sized enterprises in the Member States. Small and medium-sized enterprises can often be effective participants in research and development but they have to put up with less favourable conditions than those that apply to large international corporations. From now on, SME associations performing research and development can avail of financial support from Europe and operate within a European network together with other small and medium-sized enterprises. Slovak SMEs will thus be able to contribute their knowledge and capacities to the European research and development sector. In Slovakia many small and medium-sized enterprises are located in rural areas with less developed infrastructure, which hampers their development. Many women are employed in research and development performing SMEs, whether directly or indirectly. European funds are useful because they give SMEs a start, thus allowing their professional capacities to serve the common interest. The Eurostars programme is a programme for researching and developing new products and services at European Union level. SMEs play a key role in Eurostars projects. It is a real pity that the Slovak Republic, an EU Member State, does not participate in this programme. Slovakia’s small and medium-sized enterprises consequently have no access to the significant financial support available for the effective development of new products, techniques and services.
costep_2001-05-02_7_3	Mr President, Mrs Lejon, Commissioner, today is a joyful day for the citizens of the European Union. After years of sabotage and delay, there is now a Regulation before us which addresses public access to the EU institutions. This European Parliament has pressed for this to happen for years. Since 1979, I have been one of the MEPs who repeatedly put the need for public access on the agenda, even when I was allowed to sit on the European Council of Ministers. Indeed, public access is directly linked to the democratic content of an institution and guards a government body from underhand politics, nepotism and financial irregularities. When this proposal was submitted by the European Commission last year, it left a great deal to be desired. The French Council proposal, which appeared subsequently, was not acceptable either. In November, our Parliament tabled its proposal with a huge majority. Since then, intense negotiations have taken place among the three institutions. In this respect, Parliament was a great support for the Swedish Presidency. This coalition, which has, step-by-step, brought the Council and Commission closer to Parliament’s position, has proved to be very fruitful. The outcome was a considerably improved text in which Parliament’s key points were adopted. I would like to quote seven as these proved crucial to our positive stance vis-à-vis this compromise. Firstly, Article 4, the most important article, which articulates the limitations of public access, has been cut down to size and the limitations are tied down to conditions. A reason for secrecy should be given at all times, and there is an opportunity to appeal to the Ombudsman or the European court. In the case of huge public interest, documents are to be disclosed nevertheless. That was a key element for our Parliament. Secondly, the term document should be taken in a broad sense. Electronic mail also falls under this heading. Thirdly, a register will be introduced after all, in which all documents need to be included with attendant details and which must be published on the Internet. Fourthly, the Union’s agencies, such as the European Environment Bureau, the European Trade Mark Office and Europol, will fall within the remit of the Regulation. This will happen in the near future thanks to a new act which has now been promised. Fifthly, national legislation which goes beyond this Regulation - and this is a sensitive area for the country that I come from - should not be hindered by this Regulation. This is clearly stipulated in recital 16. I should like to see it explained accordingly. Sixthly, the rules which Mr Solana imposed last year in August without any consultation now fall under this Regulation and will also be verified against the same. The Netherlands has already noted that the appeal at the Court of Justice can then be withdrawn, and I believe that the European Parliament could follow suit. Finally, an annual report will be drafted, and the Commission will need to compile an evaluation report with proposals for improvement before 2004. Is this Regulation now perfect? No, quite a few areas could be honed down further, such as the handling of documents of third parties, and the registration of secret documents, as well as a number of other issues. However, in our opinion, it is better to grant approval now and to tighten the rules in two years' time, should this prove useful and necessary. If we were to overhaul the Regulation now, we would end up in a long-term codecision procedure. Moreover, we are familiar with this procedure: the Council could put us out of action if the European Commission were not to lend us their support. I am not expecting the Commission to do this, but you never know. All that remains for me now is to express my thanks to my fellow MEPs who have helped us over the course of last year to achieve this result. I should first like to thank Mr Cashman. He has done a sterling job, but that is also true of Mr Watson, Mrs Hautala, Mrs Cederschiöld and of the other draftsmen of opinions. I would also like to thank Mrs Dean who, as Parliament official, has carried out much of the work on our behalf. I should also like to thank the Swedish Presidency, of course. I am convinced that, without the cooperation with the Swedish Presidency, we would not have achieved the result that is now before us, one that can withstand any criticism. Finally, we should be acutely aware of what is at issue: democracy, transparency and the rights of the citizens. That is the most important aspect, that is what this is all about, and this Regulation constitutes a step forward in this respect.
costep_2011-06-23_4_36	I welcome the intention of the European Commission to provide more resources for strengthening freedom, security and law in the draft budget for next year. However, I find the provisions allocated for handling the consequences of unforeseen incidents to be insufficient, in particular the appropriation allocated for handling immigration that increased in the wake of the riots in North Africa and for the partnership initiatives. The European Union must respond efficiently to the changes in North Africa, and it must be better prepared for managing unforeseen events. The crisis may burden the common budget more than planned. It is appropriate for the Commission to provide more resources for the protection of external borders, but at the same time the European Refugee Fund and the financial assets serving integration should also be increased. The overall implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the strengthening of the human rights dimension of the EU are in the interest of every citizen of the Union. Rising discrimination and continuously spreading intolerance are our common concerns across Europe. This is why I consider the expansion of programmes promoting respect for fundamental rights and the strengthening of EU citizenship to be equally important.
costep_2010-02-25_4_9	Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, at the outset, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Patrão Neves for the effort she has put into the preparation of this report. Great determination is needed, as well as a sense of compromise, to create such a coherent document. This report is, however, only the basis for building future common fisheries policy, which requires thorough reconstruction and fundamental changes so that care for the natural environment can be reconciled with development of the historical heritage of fishing. The policy must be based on regionalisation, which will, itself, be based on the conditions prevailing in different regions. This will enable correct assessment based on opinions from within the fishing industry as well as scientific opinions, and the compromise which is adopted will ensure the fair and equal management of fishing. The new fisheries policy must stimulate development of the industry in a Europe which is engulfed in the crisis, but it is also necessary to pay attention to the predatory industrial fishing being carried out particularly in the Baltic Sea, where healthy and valuable fish are being turned into fish meal for use on poultry and cattle farms, and, in exchange, the toxic Far East panga arrives on the tables of Europeans. This is a blow aimed at sustainable European coastal fishing, an industry which should be accorded particular care. It also shows the necessity of establishing a rational and fair system of catches to replace the easily manipulated quota system. This is to give an equal chance to all fishermen in all countries of the European Union. The European Conservatives and Reformists endorse the report, in the hope that the current system will change.
costep_2002-03-13_3_191	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Trentin report surely lays the initial bases for major future decisions on economic policy. These bases do, however, need to be more incisive and detailed in the proposals, so that they do not merely stand as statements of principle but can be swiftly put into practice. European leaders must apply themselves to rewriting the model for the social and market economy, bringing it up to date and rethinking it with greater emphasis on the social commitment. Signing up in general terms to innovation, training and flexibility and then backing out at the decisive moment is becoming not only disrespectful but surely detrimental to the working class as a whole. Today, to get out of this rut, class and corporate interests must be opposed insofar as they are not compatible with modern reformism. Rather than taking to the streets - or rather getting the workers to take to the streets - the trades unions should be asking themselves how much the workers took home between 1992 and 2000, given the productivity achieved by companies, which was certainly substantial. The proposal to turn employment around is based on a new bargaining structure and real pay flexibility. The new bargaining framework may be a regional or territorial system, half way between centralisation and company-level bargaining, with the aim of strengthening pay flexibility at company level where productivity is created and the individual contribution is valued. A large contribution may be made by company profit-sharing schemes, which allow ordinary shares in the company to be acquired up to a certain percentage of gross profits. It has been found that the companies with the highest profits are also those that use profit sharing to ensure that their best staff are paid effectively. In the USA, the companies that adopt profit sharing tend to have higher pay and higher returns. The pay of those who join profit-sharing companies goes up, while those that leave have to bear a substantial pay cut.
costep_2009-11-26_3_30	Mr President, Mr Caldeira, Commissioner, I wish to thank the European Court of Auditors for its admirable work for the benefit of the European taxpayer. The EU accounts allow a 2% margin of error. I would say that it is salaries and other administrative costs in particular that need to be dealt with more accurately. We cannot allow any uncertainties when it comes to these. There are, however, other cost groups where it would seem to be difficult, or even impossible, to achieve a 2% margin of error. According to the Court of Auditors, as much as 11% of the total sums spent on cohesion policy are sums that should not have been spent at all. The situation was also the same in the two previous years. As the situation is such that the 2% threshold cannot be reached, I would like to ask whether the Commission or the Court of Auditors has thought about whether the 2% figure should be reviewed, so that year after year, we do not have to say that there is no way we will achieve the threshold this year and we will not do so next year either. In future, we will have to be more careful and function more cost-effectively than we do now, and the application procedure will have to be simplified.
costep_2011-03-23_16_39	Mr President, two weeks ago, this Parliament adopted a brave political resolution, appealing - amongst other things - for the creation of a no-fly zone over Libya. Just one week ago, when the United Nations Security Council had not yet approved this resolution, we held another sitting where we were feeling rather desperate due to the imminent fall of Benghazi and ultimately the collapse of the revolution which is in favour of democracy in Libya. Last Thursday, one day later, the resolution was approved and it has been four days since its implementation. Mr President, I think it is important that we continue to implement this resolution and carry on supporting the Libyan people, while at the same time protecting them from further massacres and helping them in their transition towards democracy. We also need to tackle two other issues. First of all, we need to keep on providing extensive humanitarian aid to the Libyan people and to refugees fleeing Libya, particularly to Tunisia and Egypt. Secondly, we need to prepare for a possible mass exodus of refugees toward European Union countries. After all, this is not just the responsibility of Mediterranean EU countries but of us all.
costep_2005-01-13_1_96	Mr President, 26 January will be the second anniversary of the execution of the monk Lobsang Dhondup. This execution called forth both protests from around the world and a resolution from this House, which Beijing ignored. In January 2003, we made efforts to prevent the execution of his spiritual leader, Lama Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche, and did likewise in November 2004, when the two-year stay of execution expired. Yesterday, in a conversation here in Strasbourg, the Chinese Embassy assured me of the high probability of the death sentence being commuted to life imprisonment. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats regards that statement as a triumph for the many initiatives taken by this House and others. We have never ceased from speaking out and winning support from parliaments and human rights organisations. Again and again, we have urged the Council and the Commission to press a change of course on those in power in China. Our demands are still on the agenda. A new trial is to examine charges of sabotage and involvement in bomb attacks. This trial must be in accordance with the rule of law and monitored by international observers. In essence, unfortunately, little has changed as regards human rights in China. Bishop Julius Jia Zhiguo, who belongs to the underground church, was recently arrested. It follows that the arms embargo must be maintained. The possibility of his being pardoned opens up a way ahead, and I hope that we will be able to go down it. What we are aiming for, and will continue to aim for, is the recognition of minority rights and the acknowledgement of the right to religious practice. One essential step in that direction would be the stepping up of dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama.
costep_2009-05-05_11_47	Madam President, honourable Members, the Commission shares the opinion that you expressed in the text of your question, in other words that the Commission’s decisions have obviously led to the ordered sale of some Olympic Airlines and Olympic Airways Services businesses. These have certainly been successful with regard to competition and transport policy. Alitalia used the same model and it could be used by all airlines that find themselves in serious difficulties. This decision has therefore led to the creation of a new airline model, what ought to be the airline of the future: no more state companies but fully privatised companies. This is the work that the Commission has attempted to support. I believe this aim of privatisation is also shared by other airlines, I am thinking of Austrian Airlines, Malev and Czech Airlines. In accordance with the treaty, the Commission must nevertheless remain neutral with regard to the public or private ownership of companies. The Commission is favourable to consolidation of the Community air sector, which it still considers to be too fragmented, particularly in view of the current crisis. This consolidation should not, however, hinder competition to the extent of impairing the effective operation of the common market. The Commission or the competent national authority is responsible for monitoring concentrations carried out for this purpose under the terms of the relevant Community regulation, depending on the magnitude of the relevant concentration operation.
costep_1997-11-18_12_10	Mr President, Madam Commissioner, firstly I should like to congratulate Mr Izquierdo, as my colleagues have done, for producing this complicated, difficult, important and interesting report. We have repeatedly discussed this report during long meetings in the Committee on Regional Policy. The report evaluates the results of Community cohesion policy during the last few years, and considers it to be a basic and fundamental element in the building of the European Union, and its future. In discussing and voting on this report, we need to think about certain points which have not only been vitally important in the recent past, but will continue to be so in the immediate future, because of enlargement. It must be stressed that cohesion policy has had the positive effect of reducing the existing disparities between the Member States, as regards cohesion and other aspects. However, there are still regrettable regional differences in income, while differences in unemployment rates have increased. This fact reveals the lack of coordination between the various Community policies, and demonstrates the need for a global approach to ensure that they are consistent with the objective of economic and social cohesion. Another worrying aspect which has arisen during the debate on this report, Mr President, is the attempt to withdraw the cohesion fund from those countries which join the first phase of economic and monetary union. This idea, which in itself displays a lack of solidarity, contradicts the spirit and the letter of the treaty, where the cohesion fund and the method for its application are set out explicitly. Projects to do with the environment and with transport infrastructures are vital for these Member States, and these projects take a long time and require a lot of funding. Nevertheless, access to economic and monetary union is absolutely appropriate, and is not at all contradictory to or incompatible with what I have just said. That is what the European Commission said in Agenda 2000 because, among other things, its legal department has set out the basis for applying the cohesion fund, and this is absolutely independent of whether or not the convergence criteria have been met and whether monetary union has been accomplished. As Mr Izquierdo’s report says, a country’s efforts to join the third phase of economic and monetary union will be of no value to that country if it is immediately punished by having the cohesion fund withdrawn. This fund is essential at all stages of the process. Therefore, Madam Commissioner, we think it would be a good idea for you to convey to this House the content of your legal department’s document on this question, so that we can learn what is in it, and devote some thought to it. It is up to us in the European Parliament to emphasize why cohesion was included in the treaty: to define a fair Europe, characterized by solidarity and social commitment.
costep_1999-01-28_1_74	The management of fishery resources at Community level is based around three main elements: fixing fishing quotas for certain species, regulating the fishing effort and the technical characteristics of the various types of fishing gear. These three elements enable us to control catches and to guarantee the continuance of the various fish stocks. It is true that fishing involves wastage of resources, mainly as a result of fish discards. The report presented by our colleague Mrs Hardstaff highlights this problem and its complexity very well. Nevertheless, our Group has tabled certain amendments to this report, as adopts a rather questionable approach to certain problems to do with fishing techniques, such as the use of trawl nets with square mesh and the banning of the use of drift nets. With regard to the use of trawl nets with square mesh, we should be aware that several scientific studies have shown that this type of gear is, in some circumstances and for some species, less selective than the traditional cod end nets. This is why the Council, when it adopted Regulation 850/98, did not consider it appropriate to generalise the use of that type of gear. With regard to the use of drift nets, this is the first time that this type of gear has been associated with the problem of fish discards. Everywhere in the world, apart from in the Community institutions, the drift net is considered to be one of the most selective types of fishing gear. Finally, we can only support the suggestion of limiting or banning discarding into the sea for certain species, and we ask the Commission to carefully examine this proposal. Titley report A4-0482/98
costep_2002-04-08_1_21	Mr President, as this is the first time you have been in this situation, my reproach is not directed at you; in recent years, though, I have known many Vice-Presidents of this House who said in discussions of this sort on the issue of Question Time that they would endeavour to ensure that it did not happen again and that it was an exception. It is, though, increasingly becoming the rule. I can give you statistical evidence that this is a fact and so I ask you as a matter of urgency to put Question Time back at an hour when it is absolutely certain that it can take place. It used to be held at the beginning of the Tuesday evening sitting and was always on time. It has regularly been wrecked, every other or every third time, since being moved to the afternoon. Nowadays we are regularly stopping at 5.30 p.m. on Thursday through apparently not having anything to discuss until 6.30 or 7 p.m. We do not sit on Fridays, yet we do not have time for Members to exercise their elementary right, guaranteed by the Treaties, to ask questions. This is absolutely unacceptable, and I am asking not only that this be changed, but also for the restoration, as soon as possible, of the Question Time with Commissioner Busquin and others, which many of us have carefully prepared for. We do not want to be sent written answers drafted by civil servants, but to be able to ask supplementary questions, as is the custom in parliaments.
costep_2011-06-07_15_19	Mr President, Romania’s accession to the Schengen area is a project which has involved major financial, institutional and human efforts, as it is one of Romania’s most important political objectives. Romania has invested more than EUR 1 billion and the results have definitely been positive in all the evaluation reports. All the Schengen acquis conditions have been met. Romania manages one of the European Union’s longest external borders, as a result of which it has developed the most advanced, integrated security system, complying with the standards set by the Schengen acquis. Romania and the agency Frontex have strengthened their partnership. In the Frontex operations carried out in Greece, Romania was the second main contributor, after Germany, of equipment and human resources. In the event of a huge influx of immigrants at the border, specialist immigration and asylum mechanisms have been implemented in partnership with similar institutions in other Member States, Germany and the Netherlands. In terms of the efforts to combat illegal trafficking, every state-of-the-art method is used to investigate and collect information. A unique application has been developed in Europe which allows data to be processed in both SIS I and SIS II. The maritime border surveillance system has been presented as a model of good practice. At the same time, the authorities have focused particular attention on the fight against corruption. Constant cooperation as part of the special mechanism set up by the European Commission has produced the results showing that Romania has the necessary institutional capacity required and political will to achieve the justice objectives. I think that accession to the Schengen area is not a gift being offered to Romania, but rather recognition of its merits and efforts, and will be an obvious asset to the security of the EU’s external borders. Mr Coelho, thank you and congratulations on the way you have handled this dossier.
costep_2007-10-11_4_22	It is common knowledge that the environmental damage that goes with flying, excluding the emission of greenhouse gases, largely originates in take-off, landing and taxiing. This primarily hits the area around airports and those who live there. Their demands for reducing airport traffic are justified. On the other hand, flying is part of our everyday life, and our way of life has changed with its having become accessible to those on low incomes, pensioners and students. Even the European Union could not work if we could not get from Budapest, Athens or Helsinki to Brussels in a matter of hours. The solution is therefore to reorganise airport traffic in an environmentally conscious way. Unnecessarily long taxiing of aircraft on the ground and circling for a long time over airports must be stopped. Pollution of the area around airports would be greatly reduced if millions of passengers used the train or metro system to reach the airport instead of cars. Railway and metro lines to airports must therefore be built in parallel with airport development, and no new international airport should be built without suitable rail links.
costep_2009-04-02_10_36	Mr President, Soviet totalitarianism did not only imprisoned people. Unfortunately it also imprisoned history and its documents. Millions of pages of history have been kept hidden in the secret archives that still exist in Moscow. Entire trains transferred millions of historical documents, some stolen from the Germans but most looted directly or, as in Italy, obtained through communist partisans. We would like our history to be accessible. Europe must demand this, it must achieve it. We would like access to documents that cannot be consulted: for example, on the holocaust of Italian military prisoners, who underwent attempts at brainwashing and were held without food, many under worse conditions than in the Nazi prison camps, who died amidst a thousand forms of suffering and under torture, including psychological torture, by the Soviet communist agitprop machinery but sadly also inflicted by Italian communists.
costep_2002-02-27_11_5	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we have to vote on a supplementary and amending budget which, without doubt, is, and will remain, unique in the history of this Parliament, for we are negotiating a figure which amounts to 0.005% of the European Union budget and have even arranged a debate specifically for this purpose. We asked Commissioner Schreyer to appear before this House to discuss the reports and the action we are taking. There is good reason to discuss these matters, for they concern the financing of the Convention. This House pushed harder than any other European institution for the setting up of the Convention; we promoted and demanded it. We demanded it because we believe it is necessary to develop and introduce new procedures in Europe in order to improve interinstitutional relations and the interdependence between the three institutions. This means that there must be mutual respect, an awareness of roles, and transparency. The Spanish Presidency’s initial proposal on the management of the funds necessary for the financing of the Convention alarmed us all, for it stipulated that the Council alone would provide the money, administer it and - above all -monitor how it is spent. It made no reference at all to Parliament! Of course, under no circumstances can this be a precedent for future relations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The Committee on Budgets and this House firmly rejected this model. In doing so, we had to adopt an accelerated procedure as there was no time to follow our usual procedure. Indeed, we had to involve coordinators to discuss the matter. We could not even make proper preparations within the Committee on Budgets. Nonetheless, we did so because we were keen to ensure that the Convention could be launched tomorrow. What this House has achieved is to ensure that in conformity with our powers, we are now part of the budgetary authority as regards the allocation of funds. We are one of the two elements of the budgetary authority whose task is to decide on the allocation of funds. Transfers of funds can only be carried out with our consent, which is also necessary for the granting of discharge. This gives rise to other issues and we have discussed these as well. In the Committee on Budgets, we believe that the solution identified is a good one. We have, however, gone one better, for our colleagues from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control have added an extra dimension, which is all to the good. We will certainly ensure that the procedure adopted for the Convention, and the implementation of this procedure, do not become a blueprint for any other institutions which may be set up at European level at any time in the future. One existing institution - namely Coreper - will assume a function which has not been assigned to it at all at European level. It will be the body to which Parliament, the Council and the Commission grant the right to consent to discharge. It is astonishing: the Council will grant consent for the discharge of Coreper - one of its own institutions! This is very bizarre. This will not be a blueprint for any future arrangements in the European Union, and the discharge procedure will not be carried out on this basis in any other context. We will vigorously resist any moves in this direction. Parliament will defend its rights, and we will monitor developments very closely. However, we will vote in favour of the report tomorrow because we recognise that the Convention must be able to start its work. It is important to send out a positive signal to Europe by demonstrating that we are no longer applying the old procedures but are adopting a new approach, a new direction, and are shaping the future of Europe!
costep_2010-06-15_5_45	Mr President, Commissioner, this is an extremely important consumer protection issue. A recent opinion poll indicates that European citizens believe that the food safety situation has deteriorated over the last 10 years, and one consumer in three still does not trust the quality of produce. It is imperative, therefore, to bring up to date, simplify and clarify food labelling in the European Union so as to ensure that consumers are better protected. Allow me to raise two points. As regards colour coding, we are in favour, provided that it also contains a reference to nutritional values expressed as a percentage. What is more, I am opposed to mandatory nutritional labelling for wines and spirits. We would like to see a regulation covering wines and spirits drawn up over the next three years rather than over the next five years, as the European Commission proposed. That, Mr President, Commissioner, is what I wished to bring to your attention.
costep_2011-04-06_9_6	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, naturally, I wish to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur on this report which really signals a significant step forward in EU policies, in its invitation to the Commission to submit a proposal for a directive on the procedures to be adopted by Member States to recognise, and possibly revoke, international protection. I believe that the events of recent days between the African and European coasts indicate that we need the 'asylum package' - as it is to be called - to become a binding rule. In particular, I think of the positive amendments that were approved; for example, the whole question of greater safeguards with regard to minors, since I believe that children must not be detained under any circumstance (which is exactly what has been happening in Lampedusa, where children have been treated in exactly the same way as adults, together with adults, often in totally unacceptable conditions). It would have been better to have this directive in place before these dramatic events took place in Europe and Africa. Another very important issue is that of vulnerable people and their issues, especially women, and problems relating to family matters and reunions. Congratulations also to the rapporteur.
costep_2009-03-11_6_44	I voted in favour of the report on draft amending budget No 1/2009 of the European Union for the financial year 2009. The aim of the report is to mobilise EUR 11.8 million in commitment and payment appropriations from the EU Solidarity Fund relating to the effects of the floods which hit Romania in July 2008. I support the European Commission’s initiative whereby the EU is showing solidarity with Suceava, Iaşi, Neamţ, Botoşani and Maramureş counties which suffered as a result of the floods in July 2008. By means of today’s vote, the European Parliament plenary session is endorsing the decision of the Committee on Budgets taken on 24 February 2009. During the relevant session, Gheorghe Flutur, Chairman of Suceava County Council, presented the situation in his region affected by floods, supporting the request for funds with pictures and the statistics for the damage resulting from the natural disasters which hit the area. He indicated that warnings were sent and mentioned that, together with the authorities in the Ukrainian region of Chernivtsi, it was agreed to set up a rapid alert system in the event of disasters, along with other cross-border cooperation programmes for dealing with emergency situations due to be implemented as a continuation of this project.
costep_1997-04-09_10_14	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the present drafts relating to measures for the further reduction of vehicle emissions reflect a new approach. For the first time they not only lay down limit values for vehicle emissions but also propose fuel quality specifications. I believe this is quite right, because clean fuels enable advanced engine technologies to be used, and the combination of the two makes a direct and substantial contribution to improving air quality. This thought should guide us when we vote tomorrow. Specifically, though, it must mean specifications such as we decided upon in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. This applies particularly to sulphur, benzene and aromatics, to ensure that it pays off to incorporate the existing technological advances into motor vehicles. But a prerequisite for this is that the petroleum and car industries should have planning certainty. That is why we are already trying to bring in binding levels for the year 2005. The Commission’s proposal, though, falls far short of this. In effect, it merely prescribes something that already exists. That alone, as I see it, is sufficient reason to take an extremely critical view of the Commission’s proposal. It also has to be said that the auto programme and the oil programme were combined in a single volume, but I can see no such connection in the proposal. Overall, then, the opportunity has not been taken to exploit the benefits for the environment and human health of combining strict vehicle emission limits with fuel specifications. Most of all, though, nothing has been done to promote or improve competitive prospects, and the European industry has taken a step backwards here. When further measures are proposed, we constantly hear the argument - we have heard it several times here today - that costs increase as a result. Even more frequently, we have heard it said that if the petroleum industry invests in order to achieve these specifications that we are proposing, it will cost them ECU 0.01 per litre. So where is the harm in that? After all, it is essentially the taxpayer that will have to pay. Regarding the competitive situation of the sectors of industry concerned, which we must always bear in mind when reaching our decision, the first point here as far as the petroleum industry is concerned is that competition between companies essentially takes place at regional level and not between the various petroleum industries. In fact, in the case of the petroleum industry, I would be inclined to say 'deal' rather than 'competition', because price deals take place at board level. That is not competition at all. In the car industry, the opportunities to compete internationally lie in developing advanced technology. But this concept only has prospects of market success if for example denitrification catalysts and clean fuels are introduced. An environmental policy which creates or improves competitive opportunities - which is what we are talking about here - is a good policy. There are wide divergences within the European Union in such areas as refinery technology and the technology or age of the vehicle stock. As a result, there is a natural tendency to say that we need exemptions so that these differences can be gradually phased out. But if we take that route we shall be sacrificing part of our fuel industry, the refinery industry, to the 30 % excess capacity that exists within the European Union, and then we shall have to take the consequences - the demand for aid to make good this shortfall. So we should be thinking about safeguarding the competitiveness of the car industry and the fuel industry, and the only way we can do that is with the programme that Parliament has proposed.
costep_2005-01-13_1_121	Mr President, through this resolution we are condemning the crime of people trafficking and the sexual exploitation of minors, and also the fact that the people responsible for these crimes so often go unpunished. In the Chai Hour hotel in Phnom Penh, prostitution was taking place and women and girls were forced to take part in it. On the initiative of the AFESIP organisation, 84 of them were freed and were transferred to that organisation’s refuge. The pimps were arrested in the same operation. According to our information, the next day the criminals were freed without charge and the same type of activity continued to operate in the hotel. In the mean time, a violent group broke into the refuge, took away the women and girls and, undoubtedly, put them back to work as prostitutes. So the organisations dedicated to protecting sexually-exploited women and girls, such as AFESIP, are seeing the girls they rescue and try to rehabilitate socially being sold back into prostitution. This process involves threats and often violence against the activists who carry out this work. In this particular case, I would like to state that the Socialist Group supports, and calls on Parliament to support, the President of AFESIP, Mrs Somaly Mam, who is in great danger and has had to flee her country, having had her life threatened by the mafias who control this criminal business. It should be noted that Mrs Mam has received significant recognition in Spain, France and Italy. This impunity is the result of the corruption that is generated as a result of the huge financial profits created by sexual exploitation and people trafficking, and what makes this worse for us is that a large proportion of these profits come from sexual tourism by Europeans. The Socialist Group’s appeal is addressed to the governments of our countries, to tackle sexual tourism and strengthen the fight against the mafias operating within it. We are also addressing our appeal to the Commission and the authorities of the countries in which child and forced prostitution is an everyday reality, such as Cambodia. We should urge them, in their relations with those countries, to become involved in combating this type of activity, amongst other things by supporting the organisations involved in rescuing and rehabilitating the victims.
costep_2009-01-13_13_22	Clarity and transparency should form the basis of the activities of the European Union’s institutions. Only if we achieve a suitable level of transparency will our activities become more comprehensible to the citizens, and therefore closer to them. The institutional crisis facing the Union demonstrates to us all the consequences of adopting the wrong approach to this issue. In my opinion, it was precisely this dismissive attitude towards the citizens of the European Union which resulted in the institutional reforms turning into a fiasco and the failure to ratify the Lisbon Treaty in France, the Netherlands and Ireland. We should, therefore, draw the correct conclusions and be aware that social acceptance of the European Union’s activities should be our basic priority. In order to achieve this acceptance, the citizens should be aware of what we do, how we operate and, ultimately, what decisions we take. We need a clear, cohesive and legible source of information on the activities of all the European Union institutions. The European Parliament’s place is certainly at the forefront of this change, as it is the institution that is closest to the citizens of the European Union. We should remember that the Union was created for these very citizens.
costep_2011-03-09_11_41	Mr President, the resolution which is the product of the debate on the real economy is most deserving of support. The recent period has been characterised, above all, by the challenge which globalisation has presented to European industrial policy and real production in Europe. How the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy can be achieved, in particular, those of job creation and resisting delocalisation of industrial policy, is a fundamental question which was discussed during the debate on the subject of the resolution. In answer to the question as to whether Europe has to lose traditional industries, it can be answered that this does not have to happen, and this was also demonstrated by the debate on small and medium-sized enterprises which was held during the last part-session. The availability of, among other things, raw materials, including raw materials for power generation, is a serious challenge. We have to devote much attention to innovations and to using the results of scientific research in industry. Another important task is to make use of the synergies which exist between different areas of European Union policy, including between industrial/agricultural policy, for example, and commercial policy. Thank you.
costep_2011-05-12_10_2	Mr President, thank you very much for your compassionate and supportive words. The Lorca tragedy is becoming clear. At the moment, we know that eight people have died, among them two pregnant women and a twelve year-old boy, more than 250 have been injured and 80% of houses are affected. That is to say, from now on and for the moment, many Lorca citizens will be homeless. A large portion of Lorca citizens have also lost their places of work and with them have gone their hopes, expectations and opportunities. Lorca is a city of 70 000 inhabitants, of whom 20% are immigrants that the city has received, taken in and been able to give a new life with new meaning. I know that together, the old and new residents of Lorca, with help from the institutions and from everybody, will be able to begin a new journey in their lives. I also have to say and call on the European Union not to leave anyone behind and to be able to help those affected, recognise their pain and stand by their side, opening their arms and offering opportunities. I would like to thank you all very much and to ask for a minute’s silence. Applause
costep_1999-04-13_9_11	Mr President, many speakers here have said that we still have a lot to do before our air quality objectives are achieved, although they are objectives we are committed to both as a Community and individually as Member States. We therefore have to do everything we possibly can, and one indication that we can do more than the Commission has been prepared to is this report on large combustion plants which has been produced by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. I believe the most important aspect of the report is that it includes old plants - those which came into use before 1987 - in its provisions concerning harmonised legislation and limit values. Without this, this directive would be fairly hollow, as these plants have a long lifespan, and if we did not extend the directive to include old plants, the effects on emissions into the air would be nil. I therefore wholeheartedly support the proposal that old plants should be included. But we also have to make sure that these rules are extended to the applicant countries, as we cannot allow any sort of freeloading in this area. Obviously, resources have to be allocated to achieve this goal. I also believe we must improve methods for exploiting biofuels and for combined heat and power production, but, as far as biofuels are concerned, I believe it is essential that they should be subject to the same limit values as apply to other fuels.
costep_1997-03-12_9_21	Mr President, this morning when we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome President Santer said that an economic Europe calls for a social Europe. In the Tillich report, the European Parliament emphasizes the importance of employment, regarding it as the absolute priority, the importance of the social dimension of the European Union and the major contribution that Community funding makes to achieving social objectives. So I consider it essential for adequate funds to continue to be earmarked for the various social policy activities financed by the Union. I too am very displeased at the absence of the Council, with whom we want to reach agreement on the legal bases. Frankly, I consider this attitude incomprehensible and also as unnecessarily inflexible vis à vis Parliament in particular. I also believe it is fundamental not only to sustain our training policy but also to include in the financing of this chapter the objectives listed in the White Paper on education and training. Today Parliament voted on a report that specifically evaluated the White Paper. I would ask the Commission to continue with the work it began in 1996 on monitoring the utilization of the European Social Fund and establishing more systematic relations with the Member States in this area. This work showed that there was an improvement in the rates of utilization and demonstrated that the criticisms - like those voiced here tonight - about the under-utilization of the Structural Funds and the Social Fund are in fact unjust: we must examine and check where the problems are and tackle them, to ensure that the available resources are used in full and in the best possible way.
